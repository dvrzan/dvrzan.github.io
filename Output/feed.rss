Or if you're looking to get started using <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a>, check the <a href="https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/06/create-portfolio-website-using-publish/">How to Create a Personal Website in Swift using Publish</a> post.</p></blockquote><p>So you bought a shiny new domain and deployed your website on GitHub Pages for the world to see. Everything works as expected, until a friend of yours messages you about a typo in the <em>about me</em> section and you stumble fast to deploy a fix.</p><p>However, after deploying your website again, it's not working. Uh-oh. You try to revert the changes you made, to the state where everything worked, but that doesn't fix the issue.</p><h2>Custom Domain on GitHub Pages</h2><blockquote><p>This post won't go into details about creating or setting up custom domains. I assume you already have one and it's set up to use. Check this article if you want to learn more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages">Custom Domains and GitHub Pages</a>.</p></blockquote><p>When you set up your custom domain for the first time, it works like a charm. However, any other subsequent deployment overwrites the setup. Your website stops working on <strong>amazingdeveloper.com</strong> and reverts back to using the default <strong>yourUsername.github.io</strong> domain.</p><p>Then you realize after deploying your website with <code>publish deploy</code>, the <strong>Output</strong> folder gets overwritten and the <strong>CNAME</strong> record that was added manually through GitHub gets deleted. Your website no longer uses your custom domain, but reverts back to a default one.</p><blockquote><p>A <strong>Canonical Name record</strong> (or <strong>CNAME record</strong>) is a resource record in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System"">Domain Name System</a> (DNS) that maps one domain name (an alias) to another (the canonical name).</p></blockquote><p>There's a section in GitHub Docs under <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/troubleshooting-custom-domains-and-github-pages">CNAME Errors</a> that explains how some static site generators work:</p><p><em>"For your site to render at the correct domain, make sure your </em>CNAME<em> file still exists in the repository. For example, many static site generators force push to your repository, which can overwrite the </em>CNAME<em> file that was added to your repository when you configured your custom domain."</em></p><h2>Quick Fix on GitHub</h2><p>You can fix this quickly by opening your repository on GitHub and going to <strong>Pages</strong> section. Under <strong>Custom domain</strong>, add the missing domain:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/11/publish-cname-record1.png%20"GitHub Pages settings section and Custom domain setup"" alt="GitHub Pages settings section and Custom domain setup"/><p>When you add your custom domain, GitHub automatically adds a <strong>CNAME</strong> record to the root of your <strong>Output</strong> folder.</p><p>While this does fix the issue, it's not a permanent solution. You'd have to do it manually every time you deploy a new change to your website.</p><p>And there's a better solution.</p><h2>Add CNAME to Resources</h2><p>You can't persist the <strong>CNAME</strong> record on the GitHub repository itself, because Publish force pushes and overwrittes the content. You can't add it to the <strong>Output</strong> folder in Xcode either, because when Xcode runs the build, it overwrittes the content of the folder every time as well. If you try adding it, when you run the build, it will get deleted.</p><p>But, there is a way to persist the file on every build and make sure it gets pushed to your repository on every deployment. You need to add the <strong>CNAME</strong> record to the <strong>Resources</strong> folder. And you only need to do this once.</p><p>One of the publishing steps in the publishing pipeline in <code>main.swift</code> file is called <code>.copyResources()</code>. Inspecting this method, tells us its purpose is to <em>"copy the website's main resources into its output folder"</em>. Exactly what we need.</p><p>In Xcode, create a new <strong>Empty</strong> file and add it to the root of your <strong>Resources</strong> folder. Rename it to <strong>CNAME</strong>. Make sure to name it exactly like that, all uppercase, or it won't work:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/11/publish-cname-record2.png%20"Adding a new empty file type in Xcode"" alt="Adding a new empty file type in Xcode"/><p>Then, add your custom domain on the first line, in the format of <strong>domainname.com</strong>.</p><p>Now every time you run the build in Xcode, the content of the <strong>Resources</strong> folder is copied to the <strong>Output</strong> folder, including your new <strong>CNAME</strong> file.</p><p>When you deploy your website, the file will push to your website's repository and GitHub will persist your domain on every deployment. Much better than doing it manually every time.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>I hope this small tip improves your experience working with Publish and GitHub Pages.</p><p>GitHub Pages are easy to set up and Publish has a built-in deployment method for it. It's more than enough to use for personal websites that might not change in content, or small blogs. And it's free!</p><hr><p>Please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvrzan">Twitter</a> if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.</p><p>Thank you for reading and happy coding!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/11/network-connection-alert-swiftui</guid><title>How to check for network connection and present an alert in SwiftUI</title><description>Implementing network connectivity monitor doesn't require a lot of code. But it can mean a lot between a happy and a frustrated user.</description><link>https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/11/network-connection-alert-swiftui</link><pubDate>Tue, 1 Nov 2022 08:45:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>How to check for network connection and present an alert in SwiftUI</h1><p>Most apps use some type of networking in their code. Whether you're handling user accounts or fetching data from a remote server, you need to handle network connection issues gracefully. Not <em>just</em> making sure your app doesn't crash with a fatal error, but displaying a proper information back to the user.</p><h2>NWPathMonitor</h2><p>To check for and react to any changes in network connectivity you can use the <strong>NWPathMonitor</strong> observer from the <strong>Network</strong> framework. You can initialize the path monitor with different properties, such as specifying the type of connection (wifi, cellular...) or whether it's restricted by low data. You can check the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor">official documentation</a> for more information.</p><p>In this example, we'll initalize the path to observe all available interface types (wifi, cellular, wired and other).</p><h2>NetworkMonitor</h2><p>Create a new <strong>NetworkMonitor</strong> class with the following code:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> NetworkMonitor: <span class="type">ObservableObject</span> {
    <span class="keyword">private let</span> networkMonitor = <span class="type">NWPathMonitor</span>()
    <span class="keyword">private let</span> workerQueue = <span class="type">DispatchQueue</span>(label: <span class="string">"Monitor"</span>)
    <span class="keyword">var</span> isConnected = <span class="keyword">false

    init</span>() {
        networkMonitor.<span class="property">pathUpdateHandler</span> = { path <span class="keyword">in
            self</span>.<span class="property">isConnected</span> = path.<span class="property">status</span> == .<span class="dotAccess">satisfied</span>
            <span class="type">Task</span> {
                <span class="keyword">await</span> <span class="type">MainActor</span>.<span class="call">run</span> {
                    <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">objectWillChange</span>.<span class="call">send</span>()
                }
            }
        }
        networkMonitor.<span class="call">start</span>(queue: workerQueue)
    }
}
</code></pre><p>NetworkMonitor conforms to @ObservableObject protocol so we can listen for any changes and update the UI accordingly.</p><p>First, create two private properties, an <code>NWPathMonitor</code> observer and a <code>DispatchQueue</code> where the monitor will do its work. The third property is a <code>Boolean</code> value we'll call in the View to check for network connectivity. The initial value is <strong>false</strong>.</p><p>Next, create an initializer and call the <code>.pathUpdateHandler</code> on the path monitor to handle the changes. Update <code>isConnected</code> to <strong>true</strong> when the path status is satisfied (connection is available) and notify observers for any changes with <code>objectWillChange.send()</code>.</p><p>Finally, start the monitoring on the specified queue.</p><blockquote><p>Our network monitor can be used in both UIKit and SwiftUI views.</p></blockquote><p>Now the fun part.</p><h2>Inject into SwiftUI environment</h2><p>To use network monitor in your app, instantiate it in the <code>@main</code> app struct and inject as an environment object:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">@main
struct</span> MyApp: <span class="type">App</span> {
    <span class="keyword">@StateObject var</span> networkMonitor = <span class="type">NetworkMonitor</span>()

    <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">Scene</span> {
        <span class="type">WindowGroup</span> {
            <span class="type">ContentView</span>()
                .<span class="call">environmentObject</span>(networkMonitor)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Then you can call it anywhere in your app.</p><h2>Update UI</h2><p>There are a few options for displaying different views and alerts when network connection is unavailable. It depends on the requirements of your app and the design of your UI. Most apps update the view displaying the <em>no network connection</em> text on the view itself.</p><p>First, you need to call the environment object in the view:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> ContentView: <span class="type">View</span> {
    <span class="keyword">@EnvironmentObject var</span> networkMonitor: <span class="type">NetworkMonitor</span>
    ...
}
</code></pre><h3>Change the View</h3><p>Instead of having an empty screen when network connection is unavailable, you can create and show a different view. Something like this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> ContentView: <span class="type">View</span> {
    <span class="keyword">@EnvironmentObject var</span> networkMonitor: <span class="type">NetworkMonitor</span>

    <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> {
        <span class="type">NavigationView</span> {
	      <span class="comment">// If monitor detects valid network connection</span>
            <span class="keyword">if</span> networkMonitor.<span class="property">isConnected</span> {
	          <span class="comment">// Show home view</span>
                <span class="type">HomeView</span>()
            } <span class="keyword">else</span> {
	          <span class="comment">// Otherwise, show something else</span>
                <span class="type">NoNetworkView</span>()
            }
        }
     }
}
</code></pre><blockquote><p>You can test network connection in the Simulator by setting your laptop's internet off. But it doesn't work well. It doesn't detect network issues consistently and it may not present the view when you turn off your internet. I suggest testing on a real device.</p></blockquote><p>Turning your internet on and off will update the UI automatically:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/11/network-connection-alert-swiftui1.png%20"Left: view displayed with the valid network connection. Right: No network connection view with unavailable connection"" alt="Left: view displayed with the valid network connection. Right: No network connection view with unavailable connection"/><h3>Present an alert</h3><p>Another way of letting the user know their network connection is offline is by presenting an alert on the screen. Instead of changing the view, you can display an alert.</p><blockquote><p>Some apps display both. If you only present an alert, your view will still be empty once the alert is dismissed. Present an alert to get user's attention and still have the <em>"no network connection"</em> text on the view.</p></blockquote><p>First, you need to create a property that will determine whether to display the alert with the default value of <strong>false</strong>:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> ContentView: <span class="type">View</span> {
    <span class="keyword">@EnvironmentObject var</span> networkMonitor: <span class="type">NetworkMonitor</span>
    <span class="keyword">@State private var</span> showNetworkAlert = <span class="keyword">false</span>
    ...
}
</code></pre><p>Then, add <code>.alert()</code> and <code>.onChange(of:)</code> modifiers on the view:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> ContentView: <span class="type">View</span> {
    <span class="keyword">@EnvironmentObject var</span> networkMonitor: <span class="type">NetworkMonitor</span>
    <span class="keyword">@State private var</span> showNetworkAlert = <span class="keyword">false

    var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> {
        <span class="type">NavigationView</span> {
            <span class="type">HomeView</span>()
        }
        .<span class="call">onChange</span>(of: networkMonitor.<span class="property">isConnected</span>) { connection <span class="keyword">in</span>
            showNetworkAlert = connection == <span class="keyword">false</span>
        }
        .<span class="call">alert</span>(
            <span class="string">"Network connection seems to be offline."</span>,
            isPresented: <span class="property">$showNetworkAlert</span>
        ) {}
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Alert listens to <strong>showNetworkAlert</strong> binding for changes so it knows when to present. <code>onChange(of:)</code> listens for changes in the network connectivity and updates the alert's binding depending on the network status.</p><p>The UI will look like this:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/11/network-connection-alert-swiftui2.png%20"Left: view displayed with the valid network connection. Right: Alert presented on the view with unavailable connection"" alt="Left: view displayed with the valid network connection. Right: Alert presented on the view with unavailable connection"/><h3>Present a popover</h3><p>There's not much change in code to display a popover. Both alert and popover use binding to listen for changes. Replace an alert with a popover:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> ContentView: <span class="type">View</span> {
    <span class="keyword">@EnvironmentObject var</span> networkMonitor: <span class="type">NetworkMonitor</span>
    <span class="keyword">@State private var</span> showNetworkAlert = <span class="keyword">false

    var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> {
        <span class="type">NavigationView</span> {
            <span class="type">HomeView</span>()
        }
        .<span class="call">onChange</span>(of: networkMonitor.<span class="property">isConnected</span>) { connection <span class="keyword">in</span>
            showNetworkAlert = connection == <span class="keyword">false</span>
        }
        .<span class="call">popover</span>(isPresented: <span class="property">$showNetworkAlert</span>) {
            <span class="type">Text</span>(<span class="string">"Network connection seems to be offline."</span>)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The UI will change to this:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/11/network-connection-alert-swiftui3.png%20"Left: view displayed with the valid network connection. Right: A popover presented on the view with unavailable connection"" alt="Left: view displayed with the valid network connection. Right: A popover presented on the view with unavailable connection"/><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Implementing network connectivity monitor doesn't require a lot of code. But it can mean a lot between a happy and a frustrated user.</p><p>Crafting delightful user experiences is part of what we do every day and also the reason why users keep coming back to our apps.

You're making local changes before you deploy a new version or publish a new post.</p><p>While you're working on the website, you make a change, run the build, and for some reason the changes are not applied. You run the build again and nothing happens. You're not sure anymore if what you're doing is correct or is there another issue. There <em>is</em> another issue.</p><p>Your website is <strong>cached</strong> and changes take a long time to update. That includes any local changes.</p><p>You'll see how to fix this issue in an easy way and see the changes you've made <em>almost</em> automatically. It's not SwiftUI Previews, but close enough.</p><h2>Browser Cache</h2><p>Web browsers cache resources from websites you visit in a small database of files. Common resources in a browser cache are images, text, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p><p>This data is stored on your computer and a browser doesn't know if you're looking at an online or a local server content. Resources are stored anyway. This is why when you open your <strong>http://localhost:8000</strong> website, HTML and CSS get cached. When you make a change and refresh the browser, the changes may not show right away.</p><p>Let's take a look at how to fix this issue.</p><h2>Google Chrome</h2><p>Whether you're already using it, or not, Chrome is the first choice for testing websites in web development. Their <strong>Developer Tools</strong> are the best out there. This is what you'll use to fix the issue and finally be able to see your new changes with a simple refresh.</p><p>In Chrome, go to <strong>View</strong> -&gt; <strong>Developer</strong> -&gt; <strong>Developer Tools</strong> or <strong>Option+Command+I</strong> as a shortcut. There'll be a new panel at the bottom of the browser:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/10/publish-automatic-local-changes01.png%20"Google Chrome web browser with Developer Tools opened"" alt="Google Chrome web browser with Developer Tools opened"/><p>You'll need to open Tools every time you're working on your website so you'll remember the shortcut quite fast. Tools close automatically when you close the browser.</p><p>Developer Tools are a very powerful toolkit to inspect website elements, see web traffic, and do a lot of other things we won't be getting into details now. We're interested in turning off the cache so we can see the changes we make during development.</p><p>In Developer Tools, find the <strong>Network</strong> tab at the top and click on <strong>Disable cache</strong> below it:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/10/publish-automatic-local-changes02.png%20"Network tab in Developer Tools with cache disabled"" alt="Network tab in Developer Tools with cache disabled"/><p>When you disable cache in Developer Tools, this setting with persist across browser launches, but it will only apply when the Tools are open. This won't mess with the regular use of your browser.</p><p>Now every time you're working on your website and want to see the change you make in the code, run the build in Xcode and <strong>Command+R</strong> to refresh the page and see your changes instantly.</p><h2>Safari and Other Browsers</h2><p>I personally prefer using Chrome during development, but if you'd like to use other browsers, they all have some type of developer tools.</p><p>In Safari, it's called <strong>Web Inspector</strong> and can be found under <strong>Develop</strong>, or opened with the same shortcut <strong>Control+Command+I</strong>.</p><p>Then under <strong>Network</strong> tab, you'll find the same <strong>Disable cache</strong> option on the right side of the panel:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/10/publish-automatic-local-changes03.png%20"Network tab in Web Inspector with cache disabled in Safari"" alt="Network tab in Web Inspector with cache disabled in Safari"/><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>All that's left to do now is make some changes, run the build, and refresh the page. Your website will update instantly.</p><p>There might be other ways out there to achieve this, but I've found this works quite well.</p><p>While Publish does allow us to build websites using Swift, it still requires some knowledge of web development. I hope your website development process will now become faster and more enjoyable.</p><hr><p>Please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvrzan">Twitter</a> if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.</p><p>Thank you for reading and happy coding!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/10/class-diagram</guid><title>How to create a class diagram</title><description>A class diagram describes the structure of a system by showing its classes, their attributes, methods, and their relationships.

UML diagrams are blueprints of a system. They show components and their interaction in a visual way.</p><p>When a developer takes a specific task, they might need to read the diagram and translate the blueprints into code. Reading and writing UML diagrams is a useful skill to have.</p><p>Most universities teach UML as part of their curriculum. But if you've never worked with them before, the hardest part is understanding how they connect to your code.</p><p>I won't go into too much theory. Wikipedia describes what UML is in a concise way and I couldn't have explained it better:</p><blockquote><p>"<em>The <strong>Unified Modeling Language</strong> (<strong>UML</strong>) is a general-purpose, developmental modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.</em>"</p></blockquote><p>You can read the theory behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram">class diagrams</a> if you'd like to learn more.

You can write it any way you'd like as long as it's readable and understandable.</p></blockquote><p>A class diagram has a <em>class</em> in its name but it doesn't only show classes. It shows all objects in your code: structs, enums, protocols, classes and other.</p><p>In the diagram, an object is represented with a box divided into three parts:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/10/class-diagram01.png%20"A diagram showing three different parts and their content"" alt="A diagram showing three different parts and their content"/><ul><li><strong>The top part contains the name of the class</strong>.

It also has an <strong>id</strong> of type <code>UUID</code> and conforms to <code>Identifiable</code> protocol.</p><blockquote><p>I'm using <a href="https://app.diagrams.net">draw.io</a> to create the class diagram and it's a simple free website that lets you create UML diagrams and then export them into any format you'd like. There are other websites, like <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/">Lucidchart</a>, which is widely used by companies. It has a free tier but requires an account.</p></blockquote><p>This is how the class diagram of a <strong>Pet</strong> looks like:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/10/class-diagram02.png%20"A class diagram showing the Pet struct"" alt="A class diagram showing the Pet struct"/><p>The default access control for Swift types is <code>internal</code> and there's no notation in UML for that specific access control type. Most developers omit the access control for it or make up their own sign. <code>isHerbivore()</code> is marked with <code>-</code> as a <code>private</code> method.</p><h2>Adding protocols and implementation relationships</h2><p><strong>Pet</strong> conforms to <code>Identifiable</code> so it can implement the unique identifier. To show this type of relationship in your diagram, create a diagram with a single box for the protocol and add the relationship:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/10/class-diagram03.png%20"A class diagram showing the Pet struct and conformance to Identifiable with an implementation relationship"" alt="A class diagram showing the Pet struct and conformance to Identifiable with an implementation relationship"/><p>An <strong>implementation relationship</strong> is a relationship between two models, in which one model implements the behavior that the other model specifies. It's used for protocol conformance. The graphical representation of the relationship is a dashed line with an empty triangle arrow pointing towards the protocol.</p><p>For default protocols you don't need to add any properties or methods on the protocol diagram, only its name in bold and the <code>&lt;&lt;protocol&gt;&gt;</code> notation. For custom protocols, you can decide whether you want to add the properties and methods that your protocol defines.</p><h2>Adding other models and their relationships</h2><p>The rest of the code defining our models:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> Owner: <span class="type">Experienced</span> {
  <span class="keyword">let</span> name: <span class="type">String</span>

</code></pre><p>And the class diagram looks like this:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/10/class-diagram04.png%20"A class diagram"" alt="A class diagram"/><p>The solid line with an open arrow pointing towards the class that supplies the property is a graphical representation of an <strong>association relationship</strong> and is used to link any number of classes.</p><p>The text on the relationship arrows is optional and is not required. But it can sometimes be very useful.</p><p>This is how the basic class diagram looks like from the given code. You should also be able to write the code given the class diagram, following the same principles. There are a few notations and relationship to learn that keep repeating all the time. Once you've learned them, you'll be able to create any class diagram for a system.</p><h2>What about a ViewModel?</h2><p>A ViewModel is a class that you can add as a diagram like any other diagram you've added. Let's say you have a PetViewModel with pets property and an initializer. Your class diagram would now look like the following:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/10/class-diagram05.png%20"A class diagram with a ViewModel"" alt="A class diagram with a ViewModel"/><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Class diagrams are common in programming and it's worth knowing how to create and read them.

It exists as a guide and a point of reference for creating your own theme.</p><p>Under <strong>Package Dependencies</strong>, find <strong>Publish</strong> and expand it. Go to <strong>Sources</strong> -&gt; <strong>Publish</strong> -&gt; <strong>API</strong> and open <strong>Theme+Foundation</strong> file. At the top you'll find the foundation theme:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">public extension</span> <span class="type">Theme</span> {
    <span class="comment">/// The default "Foundation" theme that Publish ships with, a very
    /// basic theme mostly implemented for demonstration purposes.</span>
    <span class="keyword">static var</span> foundation: <span class="type">Self</span> {
        <span class="type">Theme</span>(
            htmlFactory: <span class="type">FoundationHTMLFactory</span>(),
            resourcePaths: [<span class="string">"Resources/FoundationTheme/styles.css"</span>]
        )
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Theme consists of two parts. First, you have the <strong>HTMLFactory</strong> where you define the HTML components and create your header, navigation, footer, and other basic HTML elements. Then, you have the <strong>styles.css</strong> file to style your website.</p><blockquote><p>You write your website's components in a SwiftUI-like syntax using Swift language. However, it's good to be familiar with both HTML and CSS. If you've never worked with them before, getting familiar with both and learning some basics will help you design and style your components faster.</p></blockquote><p>To create your own theme, you'll need to add the above extension and define your own HTMLFactory and a CSS file.</p><p>Copy the above code and paste it in your <strong>main.swift</strong> file, above <code>.publish(withTheme:)</code> line:</p><pre><code><span class="comment">// Define your Theme here</span>
...

<span class="comment">// This will generate your website using the built-in Foundation theme:</span>
<span class="keyword">try</span> <span class="type">MyWebsite</span>().<span class="call">publish</span>(withTheme: .<span class="dotAccess">foundation</span>)
</code></pre><p>Xcode will complain it <em>Cannot find FoundationHTMLFactory in the scope</em> and it's not wrong (this time). You need to create it. But before you do that, change the name of your new HTMLFactory inside the theme extension to whatever name you'd like. I'll name it <strong>MyThemeHTMLFactory()</strong>.</p><h2>Styling</h2><p>To create your own custom theme, you need to create a CSS file.</p><p>The theme you defined in <strong>main.swift</strong> is still pointing to foundation theme's <strong>styles.css</strong> file and you need to create your own.</p><p>In your Xcode project, under <strong>Resources</strong>, create a new folder and name it <strong>MyTheme</strong>.</p><p>Now in <strong>Package Dependencies</strong>, find <strong>Publish</strong> and expand it. Go to <strong>Resources</strong> -&gt; <strong>FoundationTheme</strong> and copy the <strong>styles.css</strong> file. You can open Publish in Finder and copy the file from there then paste it in the newly created folder:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/09/publish-get-started-custom-theme-01.png%20"styles.css file under Resources folder in Xcode project"" alt="styles.css file under Resources folder in Xcode project"/><p>After you copied the CSS file, make sure to update all the properties you've changed. Open <strong>main.swift</strong> and update the name of your theme, path to your CSS file and the theme name you're publishing your website with:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/09/publish-get-started-custom-theme-02.png%20"main.swift file showing highlighted parts of code to change the custom theme name, path to resources folder of the css file and  the call to theme in publish method"" alt="main.swift file showing highlighted parts of code to change the custom theme name, path to resources folder of the css file and the call to theme in publish(withTheme) method"/><h2>HTMLFactory</h2><p>Next, open <strong>Theme+Foundation.swift</strong> file under <strong>Package Dependencies</strong>. Below the <code>extension Theme</code> is a definition of <code>FoundationHTMLFactory</code>. Below the factory are definitions of a few of the HTML components; <code>SiteFooter</code>, <code>SiteHeader</code>, <code>Wrapper</code>, <code>ItemList</code> and <code>ItemTagList</code>.</p><p>First, copy the HTMLFactory and all of the components. Next, create a new file in your Xcode project under <strong>Sources</strong> -&gt; <strong>MyWebsite</strong>. Name it <strong>MyThemeHTMLFactory</strong> or whatever name you chose for your factory. Paste your code to this new file.</p><p>Change the name of the FoundationHTMLFactory to <strong>MyThemeHTMLFactory</strong> or the name of your choice. Then, import both <strong>Publish</strong> and <strong>Plot</strong> below <code>import Foundation</code> at the top of the file:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">import</span> Foundation
<span class="comment">// Import Publish and Plot</span>
<span class="keyword">import</span> Publish
<span class="keyword">import</span> Plot

<span class="keyword">private struct</span> MyThemeHTMLFactory&lt;Site: <span class="type">Website</span>&gt;: <span class="type">HTMLFactory</span> {
...
}
</code></pre><p>All the errors are now gone and you're ready to customize your theme.</p><p>You can take a closer look what methods define the HTMLFactory by jumping to its definition.</p><blockquote><p>To read the definition of a code component in Xcode, whether from a third party or Apple's API, right-click on the code you want to learn more about and click <strong>Jump to Definition</strong>.</p></blockquote><pre><code><span class="comment">/// Protocol used to implement a website theme's underlying factory,
/// that creates HTML for a site's various locations using the Plot DSL.</span>
<span class="keyword">public protocol</span> HTMLFactory {
    <span class="comment">/// The website that the factory is for. Generic constraints may be
    /// applied to this type to require that a website fulfills certain
    /// requirements in order to use this factory.</span>
    <span class="keyword">associatedtype</span> Site: <span class="type">Website</span>

    <span class="comment">/// Create the HTML to use for the website's main index page.
    /// - **parameter** index: The index page to generate HTML for.

    <span class="keyword">func</span> makeIndexHTML(for index: <span class="type">Index</span>,
                       context: <span class="type">PublishingContext</span>&lt;<span class="type">Site</span>&gt;) <span class="keyword">throws</span> -&gt; <span class="type">HTML</span>

	...
}
</code></pre><p>There are six methods used to define the HTMLFactory. Each method defines a larger HTML component of your website, for example, the index page (your homepage), sections, pages, items (your blog posts), tag list and tag details.</p><blockquote><p>Use tags to filter your blog posts by a category. Publish creates an new page that has a list of all the tags you define in your blog posts. This list is generated automatically. All tags are defined in the metadata section of a blog post. We'll take a look at this in the future post.</p></blockquote><h2>Standalone Components</h2><p>Standalone components are smaller HTML elements you create outside of the HTMLFactory and call them in any of the makeHTML methods, depending on the use case.</p><p>For example, at the end of the file, there's a <code>SiteFooter()</code> struct that defines your website's footer:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">private struct</span> SiteFooter: <span class="type">Component</span> {
    <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="type">Component</span> {
        <span class="type">Footer</span> {
            <span class="type">Paragraph</span> {
                <span class="type">Text</span>(<span class="string">"Generated using "</span>)
                <span class="type">Link</span>(<span class="string">"Publish"</span>, url: <span class="string">"https://github.com/johnsundell/publish"</span>)
            }

            <span class="type">Paragraph</span> {
                <span class="type">Link</span>(<span class="string">"RSS feed"</span>, url: <span class="string">"/feed.rss"</span>)
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>These <em>smaller</em> components are created using <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot">Plot</a> framework and are of type <code>Component</code>. Plot parses the code your write into HTML for your website.</p><p>You'll notice a very SwiftUI-like syntax here. It looks very similar to creating a <strong>SwiftUI</strong> <code>View</code>, there are UI components like <code>Footer</code>, <code>Paragraph</code>, <code>Text</code> and <code>Link</code> inside the <code>body</code>. These are all Plot components you can use to create the UI of your website. You can find more components to use in the Plot API.</p><p>When you create a standalone <code>Component</code> you need to call it in one of the HTMLFactory methods. Or all of them. Since <code>SiteFooter</code> is an HTML component that all the web pages of your website will have, that component is called at the end of every method.</p><blockquote><p>The order of calling the components matters. SiteFooter is added at the end because it's the last element of a web page.</p></blockquote><p>The footer is rendered like this on your website:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/09/publish-get-started-custom-theme-03.png%20"Highlighted parts of website: header, body and footer"" alt="Highlighted parts of website: header, body and footer"/><p>And the underlying HTML looks like this:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&lt;footer&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Generated using 
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish"&gt;Publish&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://danijelavrzan.com/feed.rss"&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;
</code></pre><p>We won't go into details on every component and every makeHTML method. I've shown you how they work and now you can explore them on your own.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>This is where things get more complex when using Publish. You have to explore on your own. You have to read both Publish and Plot APIs code to figure out how to create components and how they fit together.</p><p>There will be more posts on this topic and how to work with the CSS file as well. This is just to get you started creating your own custom theme. I suggest you explore on your own and figure things out as you go along.</p><hr><p>Please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvrzan">Twitter</a> if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.</p><p>Thank you for reading and happy coding!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/08/publish-deploy-to-github</guid><title>Publish: Deploying your website on GitHub Pages</title><description>You've created your website and you're ready to show it off to the world.

I already use GitHub every day and I chose it for its convenience and simplicity. You're welcome to choose any platform you like, but this post will show you how to host your website on GitHub Pages.</p><blockquote><p>Want to learn how to host your website using GitHub, AWS Route 53 and AWS Amplify? I recommend watching this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE6vPHP3AoA">Deploy Your Publish Website</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/kilo_loco">Kilo Loco</a>.</p></blockquote><h2>Generate the content</h2><p>All Publish websites are implemented as <strong>Swift Packages</strong>. When you open your website's <strong>Package.swift</strong> file and run it on Xcode using <strong>Product -&gt; Run</strong>, Xcode generates all the files and folders of your website and puts them in the <strong>Output</strong> folder:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/08/publish-deploy-to-github-01.png%20"Folder structure of projects generated by Publish with Output folder highlighted"" alt="Folder structure of projects generated by Publish with Output folder highlighted"/><p>This folder <em>is</em> your website. Every time you make a change in Xcode project, add a new file or change the style, you need to run the build. Xcode will then regenerate the contents of the <strong>Output</strong> folder and update your website with the new changes.</p><h2>Setup GitHub Pages</h2><p>To host your website on GitHub Pages you need to create a new <strong>public</strong> repository named <strong>[yourGitHubUsername].github.io</strong>. The first part needs to exactly match your username or it won't work.</p><blockquote><p>For GitHub Pages to work, your repository has to be <strong>public</strong>. If you'd like it to be <strong>private</strong>, your only option is to get a <strong>GitHub PRO</strong> account or any of the <strong>Enterprise</strong> accounts. But even then, all your content and HTML files will be public. Make sure you keep any private files out of it.</p></blockquote><p>And that's it! Now all you need to do is define the deployment method in Xcode and deploy your website!</p><h2>Define a deployment method</h2><p>Publish offers a powerful set of APIs that let you customize the generation process of your website to your liking.</p><p>In <strong>Sources -&gt; MyWebsite</strong> folder there's a <strong>main.swift</strong> file. This file contains the <strong>configuration</strong> for your website. At the bottom of the file, there's a single line of code that generates your website when you run the project in Xcode:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">try</span> <span class="type">MyWebsite</span>().<span class="call">publish</span>(withTheme: .<span class="dotAccess">foundation</span> ... )
</code></pre><p><code>publish(withTheme: ...)</code> is a default pipeline that generates all the needed files and folders for you. It generates the RRS feed, site map and everything else. Behind the <strong>...</strong> are other parameters with default values.</p><p>With this single line of code, you can generate your website without adding anything else. But, if you want to customize the steps to generate your website, you need to call the <code>publish(at:using:file:)</code> instead.</p><p>After some tweaking and adding a few deployment steps, your publishing pipeline might look like this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">try</span> <span class="type">MyWebsite</span>()
    .<span class="call">publish</span>(using: [
        .<span class="call">addMarkdownFiles</span>(),
        .<span class="call">copyResources</span>(),
        .<span class="call">generateHTML</span>(withTheme: .<span class="dotAccess">foundation</span>),
        .<span class="call">generateRSSFeed</span>(including: [.<span class="dotAccess">posts</span>]),
        .<span class="call">generateSiteMap</span>(),
        <span class="comment">// Deployment step</span>
        .<span class="call">deploy</span>(using: .<span class="call">gitHub</span>(
            <span class="string">"dvrzan/dvrzan.github.io"</span>,
            branch: <span class="string">"main"</span>,
            useSSH: <span class="keyword">false</span>)
        )
    ])
</code></pre><p>In the last step, you define the deployment method with <code>deploy(using:)</code>, where you specify the GitHub project for your website. This is the GitHub Pages repository that you set up earlier. You can also add a specific branch and whether you want to deploy using SSH or HTTPS.</p><p>Finally, you're ready to show off your new website.</p><h2>Deploy your website</h2><p>There are different ways to deploy your website and I'll show you a few options.</p><h3>Deploy with command line tool</h3><p>Even after you've added a deployment method to your publishing pipeline, deployment steps are disabled by default so you don't accidentally deploy your website during development.</p><p>To deploy your website, open the command line tool and navigate to your project's root folder. Run <code>publish deploy</code> and Publish will execute your publishing pipeline. Your website is now deployed to your GitHub Pages repository on the branch you specified.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Publish does everything for you. Only the contents of your <strong>Output</strong> folder are deployed. It contains everything needed to render your website. You can push everything else to another branch of your choice.</p><p>Open your browser and go to <strong>[yourGitHubUsername].github.io</strong>. Your website should be up and running!</p><h3>Deploy with Xcode</h3><p>You can enable deployment steps in Xcode, by adding <code>--deploy</code> command line flag to an Xcode Scheme. So lets create a new deployment scheme.</p><p>Open <strong>Product -&gt; Scheme -&gt; New Scheme...</strong> and call it <strong>Deploy MyWebsite</strong>.</p><p>After you've created your scheme it should be automatically selected. If it's not, make sure you select it. After that, open <strong>Product -&gt; Scheme -&gt; Edit Scheme...</strong>. On the left pane, select <strong>Run</strong> and then select an <strong>Arguments</strong> tab. Under <strong>Arguments Passed on Launch</strong>, add a new <code>--deploy</code> argument.</p><p>Now every time you run your website with this scheme selected, it will deploy your website to GitHub. Be careful and make sure it's not selected during development because you don't want to break your website and deploy changes that are not yet ready for deployment.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Deploying your Publish website with GitHub Pages is as simple as creating a new repository and defining a publishing pipeline in your project.</p><p>You can also create an automated deployment pipeline through <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> or other CI/CD tool of your choice so you don't have to manually deploy your website every time.</p><p>We'll talk about automation process in another post.</p><hr><p>Please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvrzan">Twitter</a> if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.</p><p>Thank you for reading and happy coding!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/08/get-a-job-as-junior</guid><title>Getting your first job as a junior developer</title><description>It's already daunting enough to learn a new programming language. However, learning never stops. So when do you know is a good time to start applying for your first job as a junior developer? Is there ever a good time for that or should you just go for it? In this post, I've shared my personal experience and things I did that helped me land my first job. It took me one year.</description><link>https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/08/get-a-job-as-junior</link><pubDate>Tue, 9 Aug 2022 08:45:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Getting your first job as a junior developer</h1><p>My journey to becoming a developer <a href="https://vimeo.com/646517989">is a bit different</a>. Not everyone goes back to University after already having a degree. I've decided to get a Computer Science degree to get some basic knowledge about computers and the science behind it. While I did learn about web development, databases, algorithms and too much math, I didn't really learn how to code.</p><p>Sometime during my third year, I decided I wanted to learn Swift and become an iOS developer. After graduating, I started watching tutorials and coding along. I built a few basic apps; a weather app, a to-do app and a social media app. I created a portfolio website, linked all projects on my GitHub profile and started looking for my first job.</p><p>When should you start looking for a job? Today! I started interviewing while I was still learning how to correctly parse a JSON. Maybe not the best idea. But there's really no best time to start applying. You'll never feel ready. If the job application opens for a company that really interest you, apply even if you don't feel like you're ready. If you know someone from the company and that person knows you, you can reach out and ask for a referral.</p><h2>Resume</h2><p>The first thing you need when applying for a job, is a resume. I like to keep mine up to one page long. You can go for more. You'll surely have two page resumes once you gain more experience. But keep in mind a resume is not a <a href="https://icc.ucdavis.edu/materials/resume/resumecv">CV</a>. It's a short overview of your most important experience, skills, education and other skills worth mentioning. Keep it short and on point.</p><p>Also, it's better to have a simpler than a flashy <em>full-of-graphics</em> resume. Some companies use the automated software to screen through resumes and you want to make sure your passes. They also look for certain keywords. Take keywords from the job post and find place for it in your resume.</p><p>I took an entire week to research how to create a good resume that stands out and can get the attention of a recruiter. It all comes down to a few important things.</p><h3>Experience</h3><p>Since you're applying for your first job, you probably have no experience. If you have any internships, that's amazing. That will definitely set you apart from everyone. If you're like me and have no internships, maybe you've worked other jobs that are not strictly related to programming. Choose a few that are worth mentioning and add them to the experience section. You might have not done any programming, but maybe in your previous career you were an engineer and did some other cool stuff you can mention? Or you worked in a call-centre or as a bartender and know how to deal with customers.</p><p>On different jobs you learn different skills. It's not all about coding. If you've worked on any customer facing jobs, you gained the most important skill to have as a developer - how to communicate.</p><h3>Volunteering</h3><p>You can add any volunteer work under experience or add it as a separate section. You did some work to help someone out but weren't paid for it? No shame in that. You organized a meetup or a conference? Awesome, you probably picked a few organizational skills! You lead summer guitar workshops in your local community? Cool, it means you know how to approach teaching others.</p><p>I learned English by playing video-games in high school and being a community manager for a guild on Aion MMORPG. Good times.</p><h3>Numbers</h3><p>It's all about numbers or quantification. Try to quantify one or two points on each of your jobs on a list. I was a volunteer for a local association in my city for more than 10 years and one year I participated in organizing a summer camp for volunteers. I lead a small group of 5 volunteers and coordinated the activities. That's quantity! It also shows some management skills. I'm sure you can think of something like that to add to each of your jobs. No more than one or two bullet points.</p><h3>Certificates</h3><p>A few years ago, I was using Linux. I even made my own Arch Linux once. But then I decided I don't have time for it. It's like a second job figuring out why it starts crashing after an update.</p><p>I was so into it I got an <a href="https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/linux-essentials-overview">LE-1: Linux Essentials</a> certificate from Linux Professional Institute. I studied hard for that one. I always show it off on my resume. If you have other certificates like that, add them all.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Add another section about your skills, but don't quantify anything. One thing I've seen developers do is say they know 95% of Swift. No one knows 95% of Swift. Not even people who wrote it! Don't do this. Have a list with some skills that you do have. Don't say you know Python if you once read a few lines of code. You should be able to demonstrate the skills you mentioned. Use this section to write those keywords we mentioned before. You probably know Swift, UIKit or SwiftUI and then maybe CoreData or some other frameworks you've worked with.</p><h2>Portfolio</h2><p>As a junior developer you need a way to show others you can code. You need a portfolio. Creating a personal website is a perfect way to do that. Not only does it show all your projects, but also that you can figure out how to create and host a website. You can go as simple as editing a Jekyll template and deploying it on GitHub Pages, or something completely custom. Or just show your GitHub profile and make sure your projects have nice READMEs with descriptions and screenshots of your apps.</p><blockquote><p>If you wanted to really show off, you could create your website in Swift! It's simple enough and you already know the programming language. If you're interested. Check the <a href="https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/06/create-portfolio-website-using-publish/">How to create a personal website in Swift using Publish</a> post.</p></blockquote><p>It doesn't really matter what approach you take, as long as a potential hiring manager can check out your projects and read your code.</p><p>You might think your code is bad and you don't want to show it around. Everyone's been there. When you first start learning, your code might not be all structured and using best practices. But it's still your code. You made that app and it's working! You should be proud you have something to show off. Some companies like if developers have an app on the App Store. If you have that, even better! But if not, it's not a big deal. Having a structured GitHub profile with easy-to-find projects or a personal website is a way to go.</p><p>I had a simple website I hosted on GitHub Pages showing off a few of my projects. Some of them were incomplete so I put them as a work in progress. But I had tons of screenshots and each one describing the programming concepts I've learned while building it. During few of my interviews, I had an interviewer tell me about my website and mentioning my projects. Some of them even read my code. They all said it helped get their attention.</p><p>This is also how I got my first job. I talked with the interviewer about my projects on GitHub. He said I could code and I didn't need to do any coding sessions. So we casually talked about other things, programming concepts in general and my opinions on SwiftUI and 3rd party APIs. It was a fun interview.</p><h2>Networking</h2><p>Networking is a great way to meet other developers and possibly make new friends. As an introvert, I was always that awkward person who couldn't find courage to approach people and would stick to the corner of the room. But, I knew I had to do something about it so I slowly started to work on that. I needed to get out of my comfort zone.</p><p>The most important thing when meeting and interacting with others is to be respectful and genuine. Be yourself.</p><h3>Twitter</h3><p>One day I came across a video by <a href="https://twitter.com/seanallen_dev">Sean Allen</a> where he suggested developers should create a Twitter account. You could network and meet other developers by sharing your own experiences. I haven't had a Twitter account before that so I decided to give it a try. I started following other developers and accounts I found interesting. My entire feed is mostly about iOS development.</p><p>It can be a bit awkward to start interacting with people you've never met and just randomly pop-up in a conversation. But iOS development community on Twitter is the best community out there! I've never met so many amazing people at one place. Given that you act with respect towards others, of course.</p><p>Start by sharing your own journey and experience, ask for help and give help when you can. You'll meet other like-minded people and it's a great place to network online. Of course, take care of yourself first. It's just another social media platform. What I love about Twitter is you can make it your own and only follow people whose content you find interesting. You can mute keywords you don't want to see and only stay up-to-date with information that interests you.</p><h3>Meetups and Conferences</h3><p>Attending a conference is another great way to meet new people and learn something new. Not just by watching presentations, but just by being there and talking with other developers. <a href="https://swiftleeds.co.uk">SwiftLeeds</a> was the first iOS conference I ever attended and it was my first conference as a speaker, thanks to the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/Adam9Rush">Adam Rush</a> who invited me to speak.</p><p>I've met a lot of people that day and learned a lot by listening to them. I overheard a few conversations and learned a few things I didn't know before. Developers talk about code. It's one thing we all have in common so you don't have to come up with topics to talk about. <em>"Hi, my name is Danijela. Have you tried that new API...?"</em> is an easy conversation starter :].</p><p>The downside is that conferences tend to be a bit expensive, especially if they are in-person and you need to fly to be there. But, you can still find some local meetups that are usually free to attend and are still a great way to meet people and learn something new. Or, you can apply to speak! Speakers get a free conference ticket and it's an amazing experience to share your knowledge with others. Think you have nothing to speak about or don't have enough experience? Check my <a href="https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/05/why-speak-at-conferences/">Why speak at conferences and how to apply</a> blog post. You have more to share than you know!</p><p>I found in-person conferences and meetups to be much more enjoyable. During pandemic, everything went online. While it's great to attend an online remote conference, I find it easier to talk to others in-person. But, it's a personal preference. Online talks, conferences and meetups are still a good way to meet others.</p><blockquote><p>Have you heard about <a href="https://www.iosdevhappyhour.com">iOS Dev Happy Hour</a>? I have to say it's definitely my favorite online meetup. The concept and the execution of it is amazing. iOS Developers all over the world come together and network once a month. After a few fellow colleagues share their career journeys, you're free to choose a breakout room and talk to other folks. I've heard a few people got their jobs just by attending and meeting other developers who were hiring for a role. Do check it out!</p></blockquote><h2>Interviewing</h2><p>Interviewing could be another blog post on its own. I'm not going to deep dive into this topic. I've had different interviews while looking for a job as a junior. From take-home tests and whiteboarding algorithms to writing calculators. It all depends on the person who's interviewing you. Even different team within the same company could have different interviewing approaches.</p><p>The best advice I can give you is to come prepared and don't wing it. Interviewers will notice if you come unprepared.</p><h3>Research</h3><p>Research the company as best as you can. Look for them on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/index.htm">Glassdoor</a>. It's an amazing resource to check what other employees have to say about the company. If you're lucky you might even find some iOS interview examples from other people.</p><p>Also, <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>! People discuss companies and interviews on Reddit all the time. It doesn't really come up when you search online, so append reddit to your search query and voila!</p><p>And the first thing I should've mentioned is to check the company website. Find everything you can about the company and their values. They will likely ask you a few behavioral questions. They want to see whether you align with their values.</p><h3>Questions</h3><p>Ask a lot of questions! Prepare them ahead of time. If the interviewer doesn't leave enough time for you to ask them anything, let them know you have a few questions. Ask them if they could extend the interview or whether you should ask these question asynchonously by an email.</p><p>Meaningful questions show you've done your research and you genuinely care about the job. It's one thing that might set you apart from other candidates.</p><p>Interviews are two-way conversations.</p><h3>Algorithms</h3><p>We all dread algorithms and whiteboarding. In reality, they are not as hard as we make them. There's no other way to learn them then to sit down and code. The idea here is to show the way you approach problem solving. It also shows your communication skills. Can you present your approach clearly and do you understand the interviewer?</p><p>Ask a lot of questions to make sure you understand the problem and just go for it. Code the solution you think works well and then re-iterate on your solution and try to optimize it.</p><blockquote><p>If you want to learn or brush up on your algorithms, I highly recommed <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms">Grokking Algorithms</a> book. If you're like me and you're a visual learner, you'll love it! The solutions are so simple and well presented. You'll learn basic algorithms in no time and see how fun they actually are.</p></blockquote><h3>Take-Home projects</h3><p>These are my favorite. You can show off your skills here any way you like. Some take-home projects can have a deadline as long as a week and some require you to complete a task in 4 hours. Whatever the length, give you best here!</p><p>If you end up not fully completing the assignment on time, send over what you have and then work on the rest for a day or two and then send it again. It will give you extra points for not giving up!</p><p>If you end up with more time, use it to your advantage and implement an additional feature. Maybe take an API that the company uses in their app?</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Finally, enjoy the journey.</p><p>It took me 1 year to get my first job from the day I started learning Swift and iOS development. I thought I'd never get it. But then I watched a video where someone mentioned it's normal for your first job search to take anywhere from 6 months to 2 years. I felt much better.</p><p>Of course the end goal is to find the job and start your career. But don't skip the small accomplishments along the way. Passing a technical part of the interview and failing a system design is still an amazing accomplishment!</p><p>Learn from your mistakes and make it a point to do better next time.</p><p>Make friends along the way and develop deeper connections with people. Reach out to people you've met and ask them how they're doing.</p><p>As a junior developer, it's important to show you're willing to learn and you can communicate well. Show that you have opinions on topics like UIKit vs SwiftUI and native vs 3rd party frameworks.</p><p>It's not all about the code.</p><hr><p>Please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvrzan">Twitter</a> if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.</p><p>Thank you for reading and good luck in your job search!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/07/how-to-test-custom-codable</guid><title>How to test custom Codable initializer</title><description>Sometimes, when parsing a JSON, you need to implement a custom Codable initializer.

Whether <code>Decodable</code> or <code>Encodable</code>, depends on the use-case.</p><p>Because of that custom logic, you're no longer using the default implementation. It's a good idea to test your code.</p><h2>Custom Decodable initializer</h2><p>Consider the following struct with a custom decodable initializer:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> Conference: <span class="type">Codable</span> {
  <span class="keyword">let</span> name: <span class="type">String</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> city: <span class="type">String</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> country: <span class="type">String</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> date: <span class="type">String</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> days: <span class="type">Int</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> isOnline: <span class="type">Bool</span>

  <span class="keyword">enum</span> CodingKeys: <span class="type">String</span>, <span class="type">CodingKey</span> {
    <span class="keyword">case</span> name, city, country, date, days, isOnline
  }

  <span class="keyword">init</span>(from decoder: <span class="type">Decoder</span>) <span class="keyword">throws</span> {
    <span class="keyword">let</span> container = <span class="keyword">try</span> decoder.<span class="call">container</span>(keyedBy: <span class="type">CodingKeys</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>)
    name = <span class="keyword">try</span> container.<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">String</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">name</span>)
    city = <span class="keyword">try</span> container.<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">String</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">city</span>)
    country = <span class="keyword">try</span> container.<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">String</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">country</span>)
    date = <span class="keyword">try</span> container.<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">String</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">date</span>)
    days = <span class="keyword">try</span> container.<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">Int</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">days</span>)
    isOnline = (<span class="keyword">try</span>? container.<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">Bool</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">isOnline</span>)) ?? <span class="keyword">false</span>
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Instead of creating an optional with a default value, you create a custom decoder for <code>isOnline</code> in the initializer. If the key is missing, give it a default value of <code>false</code>.</p><h2>Mock the data</h2><p>First, you need to create a mock data for the <code>Conference</code>. If you try to create a conference, you'll see you can't initialize a <code>Conference</code> object using its properties:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/07/testing-custom-codable-01.png%20"Initializing a struct with a custom codable initializer has no stored properties to define"" alt="Initializing a struct with a custom codable initializer has no stored properties to define"/><p>When you create custom decodable initializer, you lose the <strong>memberwise initializer</strong>.</p><h2>Memberwise initializer</h2><p>Structure types automatically get a default initializer, called <strong>memberwise initializer</strong>. It's generated by compiler based on structure's stored properties or <em>members</em>. But, if you define custom initializer, you lose the default memberwise initializer.</p><blockquote><p>You can learn more about memberwise initializers in the Apple's <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Initialization.html">Swift Language Guide</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Luckily, there's an easy solution. To preserve the memberwise initializer, you need to move the initializer to an <strong>extension</strong>:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">extension</span> <span class="type">Conference</span> {
    <span class="keyword">init</span>(from decoder: <span class="type">Decoder</span>) <span class="keyword">throws</span> {
      <span class="keyword">let</span> container = <span class="keyword">try</span> decoder.<span class="call">container</span>(keyedBy: <span class="type">CodingKeys</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>)
      name = <span class="keyword">try</span> container.<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">String</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">name</span>)
      city = <span class="keyword">try</span> container.<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">String</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">city</span>)
      country = <span class="keyword">try</span> container.<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">String</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">country</span>)
      date = <span class="keyword">try</span> container.<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">String</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">date</span>)
      days = <span class="keyword">try</span> container.<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">Int</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">days</span>)
      isOnline = (<span class="keyword">try</span>? container.<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">Bool</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">isOnline</span>)) ?? <span class="keyword">false</span>
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Now you have both your custom initializer and the memberwise initializer:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/07/testing-custom-codable-02.png%20"Memberwise initializer is preserved when moving custom initializer to an extension"" alt="Memberwise initializer is preserved when moving custom initializer to an extension"/><p>With this, you can create some mock data:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> Seed {
    <span class="keyword">static let</span> conference = <span class="type">Conference</span>(
        name: <span class="string">"iOSDevUK"</span>,
        city: <span class="string">"Aberystwyth"</span>,
        country: <span class="string">"United Kingdom"</span>,
        date: <span class="string">"04/09/2022"</span>,
        days: <span class="number">4</span>,
        isOnline: <span class="keyword">false</span>
    )
}
</code></pre><h2>Mock the JSON</h2><p>To test if your custom decodable implementation works, you also need to mock the JSON data:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">private let</span> conferenceData = <span class="type">Data</span>(<span class="string">"""
{
    "name": "iOSDevUK",
    "city": "Aberystwyth",
    "country": "United Kingdom",
    "date": "04/09/2022",
    "days": 4
}
"""</span>.<span class="property">utf8</span>)
</code></pre><h2>Unit test</h2><p>Pass the JSON data to the <code>JSONDecoder.decode(_:from:)</code> and test whether the decoded output is equal to the expected <code>conference</code> seed:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> test_customDecoding_returnsExpectedValue() {
    <span class="comment">//Given</span>
    <span class="keyword">let</span> conference = <span class="type">Seed</span>.<span class="property">conference</span>

    <span class="comment">//When</span>
    <span class="keyword">let</span> decodedConference = <span class="keyword">try</span>? <span class="type">JSONDecoder</span>().<span class="call">decode</span>(<span class="type">Conference</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, from: conferenceData)

    <span class="comment">//Then</span>
    <span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(
        decodedConference,
        conference,
        <span class="string">"Decoded JSON doesn't match the given Conference() object"</span>
    )
}
</code></pre><p>Now, Xcode will complain once more:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/07/testing-custom-codable-03.png%20"When asserting two values are equal, add Equatable conformance"" alt="When asserting two values are equal, add Equatable conformance"/><p>Because you're testing for equality, you need to add the <code>Equatable</code> conformance to the <code>Conference</code> struct:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> Conference: <span class="type">Codable</span>, <span class="type">Equatable</span> {
  ...
}
</code></pre><p>That's it! You should have a passing unit test for your custom decodable initializer.</p><blockquote><p>Make sure your conference seed and the JSON you're testing with have identical data. If one value is incorrect, the test will fail.</p></blockquote><h2>Failing test</h2><p>If your test fails, <code>XCTAssertEqual</code> doesn't really give any useful information on why and where the test failed:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/07/testing-custom-codable-04.png%20"XCTAssert fails and shows a lengthy error"" alt="XCTAssert fails and shows a lengthy error"/><p>Imagine testing against an array of data or a large nested JSON. It would be impossible to look where the test failed.</p><p>Krzysztof Zabłocki (<a href="https://twitter.com/merowing_">@merowing_</a>), created a pretty cool library to help you identify the difference between two instances, conveniently called <a href="https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Difference">Difference</a>.</p><p>When you import the library to your project, instead of the obscure error message, you'll see this:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/07/testing-custom-codable-05.png%20"XCTAssert error when using a library called Difference"" alt="XCTAssert error when using a library called Difference"/><p>Pretty cool, right? I use the library in my projects and I can tell you it helps a lot when you have large JSON files.

In this post, you'll learn how to add sections and content with markdown files.</description><link>https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/06/publish-creating-content-with-markdown</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 08:45:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Publish: Creating Website Content with Markdown</h1><blockquote><p>If you're wondering how to get started using <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a>, check the <a href="https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/06/create-portfolio-website-using-publish/">How to Create a Personal Website in Swift using Publish</a> post. Continue reading to learn how to create content for your website with markdown files.</p></blockquote><h2>Project Structure</h2><p>Publish generates static websites as Xcode Packages where the executable product is your website.<br><br>When you open <strong>Package.swift</strong> for the first time, you'll see the following folder structure:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/06/publish-creating-content-with-markdown-01.png%20"Folder structure of projects generated by Publish"" alt="Folder structure of projects generated by Publish"/><h3>Content</h3><p><strong>Content</strong> is where you put your website's content; blog posts, sections, and pages.</p><p>Publish lets you generate your website's content in two ways: by using markdown files or programmatically. When you add markdown files to <strong>Content</strong>, Publish parses the content automatically. It uses <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/ink.git">Ink</a> markdown parser library, created by John Sundell.</p><p>We'll explore how to generate content with markdown files in the rest of the article.</p><h3>Output</h3><p><strong>Output</strong> is the main folder of your website. It contains all the files necessary to display the content of the website. It's generated every time you build the project in Xcode. Once you start adding more content and custom pages to your website, you'll see more files and folders appear.</p><blockquote><p>You don't add or edit anything in this folder as it contains all the content and information to generate your website. Consider it as <em>read-only</em>. You'll see <strong>feed</strong> and <strong>sitemap</strong> files there along with <strong>styles.css</strong>. This CSS file is the pre-defined styling for your website, but you'll learn how to customize it and add custom styling in the later post.</p></blockquote><h3>Resources</h3><p><strong>Resources</strong> is where you add any media files for your content, like images, videos, audio, and fonts.</p><h3>Sources</h3><p><strong>Sources</strong> has all the <em>Swift</em> files to build your website. Currently, there's one <strong>main.swift</strong> file which contains a configuration information for your website. You can add sections, specific item metadata, website properties, and configure publishing steps:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/06/publish-creating-content-with-markdown-02.png%20"main.swift file showing the pre-defined configuration for the website"" alt="main.swift file showing the pre-defined configuration for the website"/><blockquote><p>Publish uses specific terminology to refer to basic structure of the website. <strong>Pages</strong> are standalone webpages on your website. <strong>Sections</strong> are special types of webpages, navigated using navigation menu. <strong>Items</strong> are blog posts.</p></blockquote><h2>Content Structure</h2><p>When you first generate your website, you'll see two items in <strong>Content</strong>; <strong>index.md</strong> file and <strong>posts</strong> folder. Inside <strong>posts</strong>, there are two files: <strong>index.md</strong> and <strong>first-post.md</strong>.</p><p>The root index file is your website's homepage. You can see it when you open the website in your browser:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/06/create-portfolio-website-using-publish-03.png%20"MyWebsite running on local server in Google Chrome"" alt="MyWebsite running on local server in Google Chrome"/><p>Right now, if you try to add anything inside the markdown file it won't render on the website. As you can see, the file is empty, but the homepage of your website has some data displayed. These components get added programmatically using the built-in <strong>Foundation</strong> theme that Publish ships with. Anything you add in both index files is overriden programmatically.</p><p>You won't be creating a custom theme in this post, but you can take a look at the built-in theme and how the components get created programmatically. Under <strong>Package Dependencies</strong>, find <strong>Publish</strong> and expand it. Go to <strong>Sources</strong> -&gt; <strong>Publish</strong> -&gt; <strong>API</strong> and open <strong>Theme+Foundation</strong> file:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/06/publish-creating-content-with-markdown-03.png%20"Theme+Foudation.swift file showing the first few lines of code"" alt="Theme+Foudation.swift file showing the first few lines of code"/><blockquote><p>We'll take a look at how to build a custom theme in one of the future posts.</p></blockquote><p>You can try adding more markdown files to <strong>posts</strong> as additional blog posts and once you build your website, they will all appear on your homepage.</p><h2>Adding Sections</h2><p>Open <strong>main.swift</strong> file and add two more sections under <code>SectionID</code>. You can add any section you want. Let's add <strong>about</strong> and <strong>portfolio</strong> sections:</p><pre><code><span class="comment">// This type acts as the configuration for your website.</span>
<span class="keyword">struct</span> MyWebsite: <span class="type">Website</span> {
    <span class="keyword">enum</span> SectionID: <span class="type">String</span>, <span class="type">WebsiteSectionID</span> {
        <span class="comment">// Add the sections that you want your website to contain here:</span>
        <span class="keyword">case</span> posts
        <span class="comment">// New sections</span>
        <span class="keyword">case</span> about
        <span class="keyword">case</span> portfolio
    }
    ...
</code></pre><p>Build the project and you'll see two new folders under <strong>Output</strong>: <strong>about</strong> and <strong>portfolio</strong>. Refresh your website and you'll see two more sections in your navigation menu.</p><p>To populate your new section pages with content, add <strong>about.md</strong> and <strong>portfolio.md</strong> files to the root of <strong>Content</strong> folder. The files need to have the same name as sections. Then write some markdown inside. Build the project and refresh the website:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/06/publish-creating-content-with-markdown-04.png%20"About webpage showing the section's content and three navigation menu items: My Posts, About and Portfolio"" alt="About webpage showing the section's content and three navigation menu items: My Posts, About and Portfolio"/><h2>Adding Pages</h2><p>To add standalone pages that you can navigate to using navigation menu, add the markdown file for the page in the root of <strong>Content</strong>. Then, link to the page anywhere you'd like.</p><p>Let's say you want to add a custom <strong>Contact</strong> page. Create a <strong>contact.md</strong> file and add the link to it in about section with markdown <code>[Contact me](/contact)</code>.

The biggest decision you need to make is choose the tech stack to build the website.</p><h2>CMS or a Static Site</h2><p>You could go with the <strong>Content Management Service (CMS)</strong> that lets you build a website without knowing any web development, like <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> or <a href="https://webflow.com">Webflow</a>. If you're feeling more adventorous and want something simple yet customizable, you could choose a static site generator.</p><blockquote><p>Of course, there's always an option to build the entire website yourself. But, let's be honest, who has time for that? Besides, there are many great options out there to choose from!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Static site generator</strong> is an alternative to CMS and a very popular choice among developers. It's a tool that generates a static website based on raw data and a set of templates, automating the task of coding individual HTML pages. These HTML pages are pre-built and load the same way every time a website is open. This makes static websites fast as they load quickly in users' browsers.</p><p>Dynamic websites, on the other hand, load differently each time based on any different data input, like user location, input or action, and require JavaScript code within the browser to render properly.</p><p>Static websites are also <strong>100% JavaScript free</strong> by default. Of course, you could always add JS code yourself later.</p><p>The most popular static site generator among developers is <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. It's using <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a>, a template language created by Shopify and written in Ruby.</p><p>There's also a third option that you might consider and it's what this post is all about so let's get right to it.</p><h2>Publish</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a> is a static site generator built by John Sundell to help Swift developers create their personal websites using language they already know. That's right, you can build a static website in Swift, just like this website!</p><blockquote><p>While Publish helps you write website components in Swift, you still need some basic understanding of HTML and CSS. But worry not; nothing complex that a little bit of searching online won't help.</p></blockquote><p>Every website created with Publish is a Swift package. When deployed, a pre-defined set of steps get executed that builds and renders the HTML components and styles them with CSS. We've already mentioned how static sites are pre-built, so Publish does exactly that. Apart from rendering HTML, it also generates the RSS feed and a site map for you.</p><p>Publish comes with a built-in theme that let's you get started quickly, called <strong>Foundation</strong>. It serves as a starting point and you can replace it with your own at any time.</p><h2>Installing the Publish Command Line Tool</h2><blockquote><p>At the time of writing, Publish 0.9.0 version is the latest and supports Swift version 5.5 (or later) and macOS Monterey (12.0) or later. Make sure to check the <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish#system-requirements">System Requirements</a> in the official documentation.</p></blockquote><p>Publish comes with a neat command line tool that makes it easy to set up new website projects. To install the tool, clone the Publish repo, get into the root folder and run <code>make</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">$ git clone https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish.git
$ cd Publish
$ make
</code></pre><blockquote><p>You use the <code>cd</code> command to change the current working directory and <code>make</code> is a utility command for building programs from source code. In this case you build the command line tool for Publish.</p></blockquote><p>To see the list of available commands, run <code>publish help</code> in the command line and you'll see this:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Publish Command Line Interface
------------------------------
Interact with the Publish static site generator from
the command line, to create new websites, or to generate
and deploy existing ones.

Available commands:

- new: Set up a new website in the current folder.
- generate: Generate the website in the current folder.
- run: Generate and run a localhost server on default port 8000 for the 
       website in the current folder. Use the "-p" or "--port" option for  
       customizing the default port.
- deploy: Generate and deploy the website in the current folder, according to
          its deployment method.
</code></pre><p>These four commands are all you need and will come quite handy.</p><h2>Creating a New Website</h2><p>To create a new website you'll use the Publish command line tool. All you need to do is create a new folder and run <code>publish new</code> inside the newly created folder:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">$ mkdir MyWebsite
$ cd MyWebsite
$ publish new
</code></pre><blockquote><p>You use the <code>mkdir</code> command to create new folders.</p></blockquote><p>Now run <code>open Package.swift</code> or find the folder in Finder and open <strong>Package.swift</strong> manually.</p><p>Xcode will open your new website as a package:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/06/create-portfolio-website-using-publish-01.png%20"Xcode window with a Package.swift open"" alt="Xcode window with a Package.swift open"/><p>All you have to do is, run the package in Xcode with <strong>Product</strong> -&gt; <strong>Run</strong> or press the <strong>Command + R</strong> keys. This will generate and update the website every time you make new changes. You'll see the following output in the Xcode console:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Publishing MyWebsite (6 steps)
[1/6] Copy 'Resources' files
[2/6] Add Markdown files from 'Content' folder
[3/6] Sort items
[4/6] Generate HTML
[5/6] Generate RSS feed
[6/6] Generate site map
✅ Successfully published MyWebsite
Program ended with exit code: 0
</code></pre><h2>Running Website Locally</h2><p>You can preview your website locally before it's published by running a local server. Simply run <code>publish run</code> in command line while in the root folder of your website to run the server and open the link from the console in your browser of choice. If you haven't customized the port, it will be <code>http://localhost:8000</code></p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/06/create-portfolio-website-using-publish-02.png%20"Command line output of running publish run"" alt="Command line output of running publish run"/><p>Right now, you'll see your website built with the default Foundation theme:</p><img src="https://danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2022/06/create-portfolio-website-using-publish-03.png%20"MyWebsite running on local server in Google Chrome"" alt="MyWebsite running on local server in Google Chrome"/><p>That's it. Your new website is up and running!</p><p>When you're done working on your website, go back to your Terminal and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to stop the server. When you want to resume, follow the same steps to start the local server.</p><hr><p>This is the first post in the series of how to build a personal website using Publish.

But have you ever wondered what it's like to be a speaker? Are you interested in speaking but don't know how or where to start? Impostor syndrome? You have more to offer than you think! Let's see why you should apply as a speaker and how to do that.</description><link>https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/05/why-speak-at-conferences</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 08:45:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Why speak at conferences and how to apply</h1><p><strong><em>"Prepare as best as you can, but expect everything to go wrong."</em></strong></p><p>Conference speaking is one of the things I've never expected to do myself. At least not this early in my career. The thought never even crossed my mind.</p><p>I got invited to speak at my first conference and things went on from there. Now, almost a year later, I love speaking at conferences. It's a different world from being an attendee. You get to do everything other attendees do; listen to other talks, learn, and meet new people. But you also get a sneak peek behind the curtains. You get to hang out with other speakers and have an amazing opportunity of sharing your experience with others.</p><h2>Overcoming Impostor Syndrome</h2><p>Who would want to listen to me? What do I have to offer that another more experienced developer cannot? Everyone is going to see that I know nothing and they'll call me an impostor. We've all been there.</p><p>Nobody knows everything. When you learn a new concept and do something practical with it, you gain experience. Experience is what matters and no one can argue your experience is wrong. Take that personal experience to your advantage and make a talk about it. You've find a cool new concept to implement navigation in SwiftUI? Talk about it! Share it with other developers.</p><p>Talk about topics that interest you; that you're passionate about. You don't have to be an expert on the topic to give a talk about it. The secret is to make others reconsider their perspective through yours. The only difference between speakers and other attendees is they have learned something well and they are willing to talk about it.</p><h2>Coming up with an idea</h2><p>One of my previous projects used an architectural pattern I've never heard about before. When I talked to other developers about it, no one heard of it either. So I thought it would make a perfect conference talk. I knew how the pattern worked in a large codebase and have been working with it for over a year.</p><p>Some developers like to submit talk proposals on a technical topic they want to learn more about. At the time they submit their talk, they only have a high level understanding of the topic. If you think you have enough time to learn more about it and get a decent understanding, it's a way to go. But, I wouldn't suggest this.</p><p>Try to get a better understanding of the topic you're submitting a talk proposal for. You will be more comfortable talking about it and it reduces a lot of stress before your talk. Attendees are, after all, paying to come and listen to your talk and are eager to learn from it.</p><p>The topic doesn't have to be unique either. Want to talk about an API but somebody already gave a talk about it? So what, your point of view matters too. Remember, it's all about your own perspective.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>I don't think I have anything new to say, it's all covered before</em></strong> is only your brain trying to convince you not to do it. It's scary and inconvenient. After all, we like being comfortable. Break out of it and do it! You'll feel amazing afterwards. There's nothing like that feeling of accomplishment after you've delivered your talk.</p></blockquote><p>Once you have a topic (or a few) in mind that you feel you're ready to give a talk about, find conferences that interest you and start applying.</p><h2>Call For Papers</h2><p><strong>CFP</strong> or Call For Papers is a first step in the process. Conferences usually open their CFPs six to four months before the conference and give a month or two for speakers to apply.</p><p>Once you start the application process, your talk doesn't need to be ready. You might start working on your slides and practicing your talk a month or two before the conference. Or as soon as you'd like, but I don't recommend leaving it until the last minute, especially if you're not familiar with the topic. Other things may come up that you weren't expecting and you'll end up rushing and doing sloppy work. The more prepared you are for your talk - the less stressed you'll be.</p><blockquote><p>Of course, no amount of preparation will reduce the stress as you're about to go on stage. Even experienced speakers with years of experience behind them get stressed before the talk. It's completely human. Remember to breathe, drink some water, and you'll do great!</p></blockquote><p>Application process starts with a form and three important fields that you need to fill; talk title, talk description, and about yourself. Some of them may ask more details, but these are consistent parts of every application. Let's talk about each of them.</p><h3>Talk Title</h3><p>Talk title is the first thing conference attendeeds see. You want to keep it short, but descriptive enough to convey the message your talk will give.</p><p>For my iOSDevUK '22 talk about Publish framework to build static websites in Swift, I came up with the title: <strong>"Swift your personal website using Publish"</strong>. In Publish, you write your website components in Swift programming language. The end result is a fast and responsive (swift) static website. I thought it would be a nice play with words.</p><p>Once you have the talk title ready, it's time to come up with the talk description.</p><h3>Talk Description</h3><p>Talk description should answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>Why are you giving this talk?</li><li>What is the purpose of the talk?</li><li>What will the audience take away from it?</li></ul><p>This doesn't mean the description should be a massive block of text. If there is no requirement in the CFP form, keep it around 100 - 150 words long. Nobody likes to read a wall of text. The person reading the description should be able to have answers to the above questions. The idea is to make it interesting so people want to see your talk. Especially if a conference has more tracks.</p><p>This part of application is also called an <strong>abstract</strong>, which means that your talk description should be exactly that. If you know what you want to talk about, then write specific things. But if you have an idea or are not quite sure what approach you want to take, try to write it without anything specific so you have some room to change it up later.</p><p>It's all about balance. Take some time to write a good description and ask others for feedback. Remember to run it through a spell check too, you don't want grammatical errors in there. It shows that you care and are ready to deliver an amazing talk.</p><blockquote><p>One thing I like to do is take a look at how other speakers write their talk titles and descriptions to get inspiration from them. Open any conference website and find talks from previous years. You might get an idea from there.</p></blockquote><p>You wrote the hardest part of application, well done! Now's the time to think about yourself.</p><h3>About Yourself</h3><p>It may sound simple, but I always spend so much time writing and changing the <strong>About Me</strong> part. Use this part of application to tell people a little about yourself. I've seen developers write around 100-150 words. Or you can make it as short as you'd like. I've even seen conferences asking for 200 words of text.</p><p>Mention what you do, where you're from and where you work. Add a little bit about your personal life, like hobbies or fun facts. Write anything you want to share with attendee so they get to know you. If there's no requirement, choose whether you want to write it in first or third person. I've seen different approaches on this. It's up to you.</p><h3>Final thoughts</h3><p>Talk title and description are what conference organizers look at when deciding whether to accept your talk proposal. Make it count! Take time to refine your idea. You have more than enough time to submit a talk proposal. I like to take notes on things I've learned and later revisit them to see if they'd make a great conference talk or a blog post.</p><p>Finally, get excited, you submitted your first talk!</p><p>Don't get discouraged if your talk doesn't get accepted. Conferences get hundreds of applications and have to make a choice what would be of most interest to all attendees. You're always welcome to submit multiple applications and apply to more than one conference.</p><hr><p>Please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvrzan">Twitter</a> if you have any questions or comments. I'd be more than happy to provide any guidance or take a look at your application and provide feedback. Remember, you have more to share about your experience than you think. Anything interesting that you've worked on is a potential topic for a conference talk.</p><p>Thank you for reading and I'm looking forward to seeing your talks!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/05/how-to-test-published-property</guid><title>How to test @Published property with XCTest</title><description>@Published properties stream values over time and any changes on the property are immediately sent to all observers. Let's recap how the property works and then we'll take a look at how we can test @Published properties using Apple's testing framework - XCTest.</description><link>https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/05/how-to-test-published-property</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 08:45:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>How to test @Published property with XCTest</h1><p>How you're testing a functionality of your code depends on what you want to test and understanding how the code works. Let's start with a quick recap of <code>@Published</code> property.</p><h2>@Published property</h2><p><code>@Published</code> properties stream values over time. When the property's marked as <code>@Published</code> it gets assigned a <code>willSet</code> observer. Any changes on the property are immediately sent to all observers.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> VideoListViewModel {
  <span class="keyword">@Published var</span> videos = [<span class="type">Video</span>]()
}
</code></pre><p>Observers are views that watch for any upcoming changes on the property to decide if they need to redraw themselves to display newest data. For view to receive any upcoming updates, you need to mark the object you want to observe with <code>@ObservedObject</code>.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> ContentView: <span class="type">View</span> {
  <span class="keyword">@ObservedObject var</span> viewModel: <span class="type">VideoListViewModel</span>

  <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> {
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Then any type marked as <code>@ObservedObject</code> needs to conform to <strong>ObservableObject</strong> protocol. Conforming to this protocol creates an <code>objectWillChange</code> publisher. It allows observes to watch for any future changes to its <code>@Published</code> properties.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> VideoListViewModel: <span class="type">ObservableObject</span> {
  ...
}
</code></pre><h2>Testing current value with direct access</h2><p><code>@Published</code> property is still <strong><em>just</em></strong> like any other property and we can get its current (wrapped) value by asking for it directly.</p><p>One of the use cases here is to test the initial value of the property.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> test_videos_initialValue_isEmpty() {
  <span class="keyword">let</span> viewModel = <span class="type">VideoListViewModel</span>()

  <span class="call">XCTAssertTrue</span>(
      viewModel.<span class="property">videos</span>.<span class="property">isEmpty</span>,
      <span class="string">"Expected initial value to be empty, but got</span> \(viewModel.<span class="property">videos</span>)<span class="string">."</span>
  )
}
</code></pre><p>Another use case is testing a synchonous operation. A simple example would be to append new values to <strong>videos</strong> array with <code>.append(_:)</code>.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> appendVideos() {
  videos.<span class="call">append</span>(<span class="type">Video</span>(name:<span class="string">"My First Video"</span>))
  videos.<span class="call">append</span>(<span class="type">Video</span>(name:<span class="string">"My Second Video"</span>))
  videos.<span class="call">append</span>(<span class="type">Video</span>(name:<span class="string">"My Third Video"</span>))
  videos.<span class="call">append</span>(<span class="type">Video</span>(name:<span class="string">"My Fourth Video"</span>))
}
</code></pre><p>You can assert property's current value after the function gets called. The operation will complete before the assertion.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> test_videos_whenAppendVideosCalled_hasFourVideos() {
  <span class="comment">//Given</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> viewModel = <span class="type">VideoListViewModel</span>()
  <span class="comment">//When</span>
  viewModel.<span class="call">appendVideos</span>()
  <span class="comment">//Then</span>
  <span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(viewModel.<span class="property">videos</span>.<span class="property">count</span>, <span class="number">4</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>The whole point of <code>@Published</code> properties is to stream any changes to the view before the value is set. It's like giving someone a heads up something will happen before it does. In that case, you'd want to test the values sent to the view.</p><h2>Testing published value by subscribing to it</h2><p><code>@Published</code> properties stream values over time. To get the published (projected) value of the property, you need to subscribe to it with <code>.sink(receiveValue:)</code>.</p><blockquote><p>While word <strong>sink</strong> might sound confusing at first, it's a common math term. It's often used in engineering and refers to end location of anything that flows (water, data, time, heat etc.). <strong>Source</strong> is where the flow starts and <strong>sink</strong> is where the flow ends. In graph theory, sink is a node of a directed graph with no exiting edges; meaning all directed edges flow towards it. In <strong>Combine</strong>, reactive stream flows towards <code>.sink(receiveValue:)</code>.</p></blockquote><p>To fetch data for the <code>@Published</code> property you'll likely have an asynchronous operation, so you need to use test expectations.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> test_videos_whenFetchVideosCalled_hasFourVideos() <span class="keyword">async</span> {
  <span class="comment">//Given</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> viewModel = <span class="type">VideoListViewModel</span>()
  <span class="keyword">let</span> expectation = <span class="type">XCTestExpectation</span>(description: <span class="string">"Publishes 4 videos"</span>)

  viewModel.<span class="property">$videos</span>
    <span class="comment">// Remove the first (initial) value - we don't need it</span>
    .<span class="call">dropFirst</span>()
    .<span class="call">sink</span>(receiveValue: {
      <span class="comment">// Assert there are 4 new values</span>
      <span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>($0.<span class="property">count</span>, <span class="number">4</span>)
      <span class="comment">// Fulfill the expectation</span>
      expectation.<span class="call">fulfill</span>()
    })
    .<span class="call">store</span>(in: &amp;cancellables)

  <span class="comment">//When</span>
  <span class="keyword">await</span> viewModel.<span class="call">fetchVideos</span>()

  <span class="comment">//Then</span>
  <span class="call">wait</span>(for: [expectation], timeout: <span class="number">1</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>These two examples are common use cases of how you can approach testing your <code>@Published</code> properties. There may be more complex use cases and it all depends on your code. I hope this gives you an idea and a good starting point.</p><hr><p>Please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvrzan">Twitter</a> if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.
