I already use GitHub every day and I chose it for its convenience and simplicity. You're welcome to choose any platform you like, but this post will show you how to host your website on GitHub Pages.</p><blockquote><p>Want to learn how to host your website using GitHub, AWS Route 53 and AWS Amplify? I recommend watching this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE6vPHP3AoA">Deploy Your Publish Website</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/kilo_loco">Kilo Loco</a>.</p></blockquote><h2>Generate the content</h2><p>All Publish websites are implemented as <strong>Swift Packages</strong>. When you open your website's <strong>Package.swift</strong> file and run it on Xcode using <strong>Product -&gt; Run</strong>, Xcode generates all the files and folders of your website and puts them in the <strong>Output</strong> folder:</p><img src="/images/posts/2022/08/publish-deploy-to-github-01.png "Folder structure of projects generated by Publish with Output folder highlighted"" alt="Folder structure of projects generated by Publish with Output folder highlighted"/><p>This folder <em>is</em> your website. Every time you make a change in Xcode project, add a new file or change the style, you need to run the build. Xcode will then regenerate the contents of the <strong>Output</strong> folder and update your website with the new changes.</p><h2>Setup GitHub Pages</h2><p>To host your website on GitHub Pages you need to create a new <strong>public</strong> repository named <strong>[yourGitHubUsername].github.io</strong>. The first part needs to exactly match your username or it won't work.</p><blockquote><p>For GitHub Pages to work, your repository has to be <strong>public</strong>. If you'd like it to be <strong>private</strong>, your only option is to get a <strong>GitHub PRO</strong> account or any of the <strong>Enterprise</strong> accounts. But even then, all your content and HTML files will be public. Make sure you keep any private files out of it.</p></blockquote><p>And that's it! Now all you need to do is define the deployment method in Xcode and deploy your website!</p><h2>Define a deployment method</h2><p>Publish offers a powerful set of APIs that let you customize the generation process of your website to your liking.</p><p>In <strong>Sources -&gt; MyWebsite</strong> folder there's a <strong>main.swift</strong> file. This file contains the <strong>configuration</strong> for your website. At the bottom of the file, there's a single line of code that generates your website when you run the project in Xcode:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">try</span> <span class="type">MyWebsite</span>().<span class="call">publish</span>(withTheme: .<span class="dotAccess">foundation</span> ... )
</code></pre><p><code>publish(withTheme: ...)</code> is a default pipeline that generates all the needed files and folders for you. It generates the RRS feed, site map and everything else. Behind the <strong>...</strong> are other parameters with default values.</p><p>With this single line of code, you can generate your website without adding anything else. But, if you want to customize the steps to generate your website, you need to call the <code>publish(at:using:file:)</code> instead.</p><p>After some tweaking and adding a few deployment steps, your publishing pipeline might look like this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">try</span> <span class="type">MyWebsite</span>()
    .<span class="call">publish</span>(using: [
        .<span class="call">addMarkdownFiles</span>(),
        .<span class="call">copyResources</span>(),
        .<span class="call">generateHTML</span>(withTheme: .<span class="dotAccess">foundation</span>),
        .<span class="call">generateRSSFeed</span>(including: [.<span class="dotAccess">posts</span>]),
        .<span class="call">generateSiteMap</span>(),
        <span class="comment">// Deployment step</span>
        .<span class="call">deploy</span>(using: .<span class="call">gitHub</span>(
            <span class="string">"dvrzan/dvrzan.github.io"</span>,
            branch: <span class="string">"main"</span>,
            useSSH: <span class="keyword">false</span>)
        )
    ])
</code></pre><p>In the last step, you define the deployment method with <code>deploy(using:)</code>, where you specify the GitHub project for your website. This is the GitHub Pages repository that you set up earlier. You can also add a specific branch and whether you want to deploy using SSH or HTTPS.</p><p>Finally, you're ready to show off your new website.</p><h2>Deploy your website</h2><p>There are different ways to deploy your website and I'll show you a few options.</p><h3>Deploy with command line tool</h3><p>Even after you've added a deployment method to your publishing pipeline, deployment steps are disabled by default so you don't accidentally deploy your website during development.</p><p>To deploy your website, open the command line tool and navigate to your project's root folder. Run <code>publish deploy</code> and Publish will execute your publishing pipeline. Your website is now deployed to your GitHub Pages repository on the branch you specified.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Publish does everything for you. Only the contents of your <strong>Output</strong> folder are deployed. It contains everything needed to render your website. You can push everything else to another branch of your choice.</p><p>Open your browser and go to <strong>[yourGitHubUsername].github.io</strong>. Your website should be up and running!</p><h3>Deploy with Xcode</h3><p>You can enable deployment steps in Xcode, by adding <code>--deploy</code> command line flag to an Xcode Scheme. So lets create a new deployment scheme.</p><p>Open <strong>Product -&gt; Scheme -&gt; New Scheme...</strong> and call it <strong>Deploy MyWebsite</strong>.</p><p>After you've created your scheme it should be automatically selected. If it's not, make sure you select it. After that, open <strong>Product -&gt; Scheme -&gt; Edit Scheme...</strong>. On the left pane, select <strong>Run</strong> and then select an <strong>Arguments</strong> tab. Under <strong>Arguments Passed on Launch</strong>, add a new <code>--deploy</code> argument.</p><p>Now every time you run your website with this scheme selected, it will deploy your website to GitHub. Be careful and make sure it's not selected during development because you don't want to break your website and deploy changes that are not yet ready for deployment.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Deploying your Publish website with GitHub Pages is as simple as creating a new repository and defining a publishing pipeline in your project.</p><p>You can also create an automated deployment pipeline through <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> or other CI/CD tool of your choice so you don't have to manually deploy your website every time.</p><p>We'll talk about automation process in another post.</p><hr><p>Please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvrzan">Twitter</a> if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.</p><p>Thank you for reading and happy coding!</p></div></article></div><footer><p>Copyright © 2023 Danijela Vrzan.
