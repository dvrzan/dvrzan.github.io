This one being number 31.</p><p>It may not seem like much over two years, but I'm trying.</p><p>There are days where I can't wait to share something new I've learned. And then there are days where I don't feel like writing at all.</p><p>I remind myself of this image:</p><img src="https://www.danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2024/02/year-wrap-2023-01.png "What showing up means"" alt="What showing up means"/><p>It's all about showing up. Even when you don't feel like doing something, do a small thing that will move you towards your goal. Once you start, you'll likely do even more than you thought.</p><h2>Goals</h2><p>I was never much of a person to set goals or plan things in advance. I could never stick on using to-do lists. If I planned on doing something, I'd make a mental note in my head. And it's always a thing or two so I can remember it.</p><p>I find this approach less stressful. Someone could say it's chaotic. But it works for me.</p><p>A goal that I had for the previous year was to release an app. As much as I wanted to work on my own app, other things came up that I decided to pursue instead. I didn't release it, but I started spending more time working on it. It's a progress.</p><p>I started a new job last year and that took almost all of my energy. I had to learn a lot of new things. I didn't feel like working after work. But I didn't feel bad for it either.</p><p>Setting up goals should be like a wish, <em>something you want to do</em>, but don't lose any sleep over it. Try again when you do find time.</p><h2>Swift Community Awards</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws">Paul</a> does a lot of awesome work for Swift community and one of those is running the <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/awards">Swift Community Awards</a>. It's an opportunity to recognize apps, conferences, resources or individuals from Swift community with categories like best conference, best developer tools or most inspiring presentation. Anyone can participate.</p><p>I was surprised when I saw my name on the list of nominations for the 2022 <strong>Rising Star</strong> award, among many other awesome people. And even more surprised when I won. I did not expect it.</p><img src="https://www.danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2024/02/year-wrap-2023-02.png "Swift Community 2022 Rising Star Award"" alt="Swift Community 2022 Rising Star Award"/><p>Being recognized like this, from people in our community, is an awesome feeling. It gave me a confidence boost that I was doing something right. I want to thank everyone in our awesome Swift Community for cheering and lifting each other up.</p><p>Just like when your boss tells you you've done something great at work. You feel good. Proud. And you want to continue doing great work. You want to continue trying.</p><p>Keep an eye out on the new edition of the <strong>Swift Community Awards 2023</strong>, nominations open mid of March. Nominate and vote for your favourites.</p><h2>Mentoring</h2><p>The last time I mentored a bootcamp cohort, it was a lot of work. So naturally, when I received an email on the open spot for a mentor, I applied again. This time for a lead position. It was even more work than the last time. But it was a great experience and I can only hope my students have learned as much as I did from them.</p><p>Mentoring is a great opportunity to put your technical skills to test and practice communication skills as well. I would highly recommend it to anyone, whether that's volunteering in a school or mentoring someone at work, it's a win-win for both.</p><p>Make sure to find a good balance between helping the person directly and leaving them a little bit to struggle and figure things on their own.</p><p>What's great about it, you don't have to be a super experienced developer to be a mentor or to teach someone. Just be willing to share what you've learned.</p><h2>Plans for 2024</h2><p>As I already mentioned, I don't really plan things in great detail.</p><p>I slowed down on conferences this year so I can focus more on working on my iOS app. I've already done a lot in the first month of the year. I'm happy with the progress and hopefully I can continue the stride.</p><p>I made a list of all the MVP features that I want to implement and created issues on the repository in GitHub. I pick one up and work on it. I don't track how long it takes. I might work on it an hour one day and then do nothing for a few days. Sometimes I'd' spend a whole day over a weekend on it.</p><p>It's an awesome feeling to see the progress the app is making.</p><p>I also plan to spend more time with my parents. Being across the ocean is not easy. Work is important, but the memories we make together are forever.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Hopefully you found this post at least entertaining or learned something useful.</p><p>Don't forget that small steps matter. If you do something for at least 5 minutes a day, it all adds up later. And you can't always give it your 100%.</p><p>Make sure to take care of yourself first. When work is overwhelming don't put more work on yourself. Go outside, take a break, binge watch movies, and just do what makes you happy.</p><p>When you feel good, everyone else around you will too!</p><hr><p>Please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvrzan">X (Twitter)</a> or <a href="https://iosdev.space/@dvrzan">Mastodon</a> if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.</p><p>Thank you for reading!</p></div></article></div><footer><p>Copyright © 2021-2024 Danijela Vrzan.
