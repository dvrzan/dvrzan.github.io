# Handle empty views in SwiftUI with ContentUnavailableView

iOS 17 brought a bag of new goodies in SwiftUI. Among them, the new `ContentUnavailableView`. It allows us to present an empty state to the user without having to create custom error views. 

It's easy to use, customizable, and has a pre-defined view for an empty **search** state.

It's recommended to be used in situations where a viewâ€™s content cannot be displayed. This could be due to a network error, a list without items, a search that returns no results and other empty states.

Let's see it in action.

## Empty search state

Search is a common feature in a lot of apps. Presenting an error screen while the user is typing is a good user experience. Never keep your user's wondering about the current state of the app. 

It's so common, that we got a custom `search` instance of the `ContentUnavailableView`.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var viewModel = ViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List {
                ForEach(viewModel.searchResults, id: \.self) { fruit in
                    NavigationLink {
                        Text(fruit)
                    } label: {
                        Text(fruit)
                    }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Fruit")
            .searchable(text: $viewModel.searchText)
            .overlay {
                if viewModel.searchResults.isEmpty {
                    // Search unavailable view
                    ContentUnavailableView.search(text: searchText)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Add the empty search state with  `ContentUnavailableView.search(text: searchText)`. It has an optional search `text` parameter that shows the search text that the user entered. 

Add it as an overlay on the `List` while the user is typing and if search is returning no results.

It looks great! No need to create custom error views anymore. It adds a system image and a default description for you.

## Custom empty states

We can also create custom unavailable views with any custom view or a more simple ones with a string and an image. It depends on your use case.

Let's take a look at an example where we're fetching data from the network and showing it in a list. 

```swift
struct ListView: View {
    @State private var viewModel = ViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List {
                ForEach(viewModel.data, id: \.self) { fruit in
                    NavigationLink {
                        Text(fruit)
                    } label: {
                        Text(fruit)
                    }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Fruit")
            .overlay {
                if viewModel.data.isEmpty {
                    // Custom unavailable view
                    ContentUnavailableView {
                        Label("Oh no!", systemImage: "teddybear.fill")
                    } description: {
                        Text("Sorry, our bears were hungry and ate all the fruit.")
                    } actions: {
                        Button("Try again") {}
                            .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If network call fails and no data is returned, we show a custom view, which in this case is a `Label`, custom `description`, and an `action`. Both `description` and `action` are optional in the above initializer.

You can also use more simple initializer with **title**, an optional **description** and an optional **image**. You don't need to create custom views, but there's the flexibility of customization.

> All strings are **localizable** as well, just like any other view component. If you're using the initializer with a **title** and an **image**, **title** is a `LocalizedStringKey`.

## Final Thoughts

[ContentUnavailableView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/contentunavailableview) is great addition to the list of available SwiftUI components. You don't have to create custom error views anymore and it's automatically positioned in the middle of the screen. No need to add custom frames or alignment.
