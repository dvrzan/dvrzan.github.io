# 2022: Year in Review

Have you ever looked back a certain period of time, a week, a month, a year, and thought you haven't done anything? I have. We all have. Sometimes I think I haven't learned anything, looking at what's left to learn. Sometimes I think I haven't done anything looking at what's left undone.

We look at things we wanted to accomplish, but didn't have time or space. Yet we often forget things we did accomplish as if they don't count at all.

Small achievements matter. Consistency matters. Not doing something matters as well.

## Wins

## Failures

## New Year 2023
