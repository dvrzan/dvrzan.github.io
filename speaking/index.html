They both follow Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture principles and often tend to be mixed up due to their name similarities. This talk will introduce you to the VIP architecture and it’s principles. While specifically made for UIKit apps to fix the MVC problem (Massive View Controllers), we'll take a look at how we could implement it in SwiftUI apps.</p></div></li><li><div><h2>There's no IF or ELSE.
