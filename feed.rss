Let's start with a quick recap of <code>@Published</code> property.</p><h2>@Published property</h2><p><code>@Published</code> properties stream values over time. When the property's marked as <code>@Published</code> it gets assigned a <code>willSet</code> observer. Any changes on the property are immediately sent to all observers.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> VideoListViewModel {
  <span class="keyword">@Published var</span> videos = [<span class="type">Video</span>]()
}
</code></pre><p>Observers are views that watch for any upcoming changes on the property to decide if they need to redraw themselves to display newest data. For view to receive any upcoming updates, you need to mark the object you want to observe with <code>@ObservedObject</code>.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> ContentView: <span class="type">View</span> {
  <span class="keyword">@ObservedObject var</span> viewModel: <span class="type">VideoListViewModel</span>

  <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> {
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Then any type marked as <code>@ObservedObject</code> needs to conform to <strong>ObservableObject</strong> protocol. Conforming to this protocol creates an <code>objectWillChange</code> publisher. It allows observes to watch for any future changes to its <code>@Published</code> properties.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> VideoListViewModel: <span class="type">ObservableObject</span> {
  ...
}
</code></pre><h2>Testing current value with direct access</h2><p><code>@Published</code> property is still <strong><em>just</em></strong> like any other property and we can get its current (wrapped) value by asking for it directly.</p><p>One of the use cases here is to test the initial value of the property.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> test_videos_initialValue_isEmpty() {
  <span class="keyword">let</span> viewModel = <span class="type">VideoListViewModel</span>()

  <span class="call">XCTAssertTrue</span>(
      viewModel.<span class="property">videos</span>.<span class="property">isEmpty</span>,
      <span class="string">"Expected initial value to be empty, but got</span> \(viewModel.<span class="property">videos</span>)<span class="string">."</span>
  )
}
</code></pre><p>Another use case is testing a synchonous operation. A simple example would be to append new values to <strong>videos</strong> array with <code>.append(_:)</code>.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> appendVideos() {
  videos.<span class="call">append</span>(<span class="type">Video</span>(name:<span class="string">"My First Video"</span>))
  videos.<span class="call">append</span>(<span class="type">Video</span>(name:<span class="string">"My Second Video"</span>))
  videos.<span class="call">append</span>(<span class="type">Video</span>(name:<span class="string">"My Third Video"</span>))
  videos.<span class="call">append</span>(<span class="type">Video</span>(name:<span class="string">"My Fourth Video"</span>))
  videos.<span class="call">append</span>(<span class="type">Video</span>(name:<span class="string">"My Fifth Video"</span>))
}
</code></pre><p>You can assert property's current value after the function gets called. The operation will complete before the assertion.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> test_videos_whenAppendVideosCalled_hasFiveVideos() {
  <span class="comment">//Given</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> viewModel = <span class="type">VideoListViewModel</span>()
  <span class="comment">//When</span>
  viewModel.<span class="call">appendVideos</span>()
  <span class="comment">//Then</span>
  <span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(viewModel.<span class="property">videos</span>.<span class="property">count</span>, <span class="number">5</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>The whole point of <code>@Published</code> properties is to stream any changes to the view before the value is set. It's like giving someone a heads up something will happen before it does. In that case, you'd want to test the values sent to the view.</p><h2>Testing published value by subscribing to it</h2><p><code>@Published</code> properties stream values over time. To get the published (projected) value of the property, you need to subscribe to it with <code>.sink(receiveValue:)</code>.</p><blockquote><p>While word <strong>sink</strong> might sound confusing at first, it's a common math term. It's often used in engineering and refers to end location of anything that flows (water, data, time, heat etc.). <strong>Source</strong> is where the flow starts and <strong>sink</strong> is where the flow ends. In graph theory, sink is a node of a directed graph with no exiting edges; meaning all directed edges flow towards it. In <strong>Combine</strong>, reactive stream flows towards <code>.sink(receiveValue:)</code>.</p></blockquote><p>To fetch data for the <code>@Published</code> property you'll likely have an asynchronous operation, so you need to use test expectations.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> test_videos_whenFetchVideosCalled_hasFourVideos() <span class="keyword">async</span> {
  <span class="comment">//Given</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> viewModel = <span class="type">VideoListViewModel</span>()
  <span class="keyword">let</span> expectation = <span class="type">XCTestExpectation</span>(description: <span class="string">"Publishes 4 videos"</span>)

  viewModel.<span class="property">$videos</span>
    <span class="comment">// Remove the first (initial) value - we don't need it</span>
    .<span class="call">dropFirst</span>()
    .<span class="call">sink</span>(receiveValue: {
      <span class="comment">// Assert there are 4 new values</span>
      <span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>($0.<span class="property">count</span>, <span class="number">4</span>)
      <span class="comment">// Fulfill the expectation</span>
      expectation.<span class="call">fulfill</span>()
    })
    .<span class="call">store</span>(in: &amp;cancellables)

  <span class="comment">//When</span>
  <span class="keyword">await</span> viewModel.<span class="call">fetchVideos</span>()

  <span class="comment">//Then</span>
  <span class="call">wait</span>(for: [expectation], timeout: <span class="number">1</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>These two examples are common use cases of how you can approach testing your <code>@Published</code> properties. There may be more complex use cases and it all depends on your code. I hope this gives you an idea and a good starting point.</p><hr><p>Please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvrzan">Twitter</a> if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.
