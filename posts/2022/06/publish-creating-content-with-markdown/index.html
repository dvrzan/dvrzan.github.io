Continue reading to learn how to create content for your website with markdown files.</p></blockquote><h2>Project Structure</h2><p>Publish generates static websites as Xcode Packages where the executable product is your website.<br><br>When you open <strong>Package.swift</strong> for the first time, you'll see the following folder structure:</p><img src="/images/posts/2022/06/publish-creating-content-with-markdown-01.png "Folder structure of projects generated by Publish"" alt="Folder structure of projects generated by Publish"/><h3>Content</h3><p><strong>Content</strong> is where you put your website's content; blog posts, sections, and pages.</p><p>Publish lets you generate your website's content in two ways: by using markdown files or programmatically. When you add markdown files to <strong>Content</strong>, Publish parses the content automatically. It uses <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/ink.git">Ink</a> markdown parser library, created by John Sundell.</p><p>We'll explore how to generate content with markdown files in the rest of the article.</p><h3>Output</h3><p><strong>Output</strong> is the main folder of your website. It contains all the files necessary to display the content of the website. It's generated every time you build the project in Xcode. Once you start adding more content and custom pages to your website, you'll see more files and folders appear.</p><blockquote><p>You don't add or edit anything in this folder as it contains all the content and information to generate your website. Consider it as <em>read-only</em>. You'll see <strong>feed</strong> and <strong>sitemap</strong> files there along with <strong>styles.css</strong>. This CSS file is the pre-defined styling for your website, but you'll learn how to customize it and add custom styling in the later post.</p></blockquote><h3>Resources</h3><p><strong>Resources</strong> is where you add any media files for your content, like images, videos, audio, and fonts.</p><h3>Sources</h3><p><strong>Sources</strong> has all the <em>Swift</em> files to build your website. Currently, there's one <strong>main.swift</strong> file which contains a configuration information for your website. You can add sections, specific item metadata, website properties, and configure publishing steps:</p><img src="/images/posts/2022/06/publish-creating-content-with-markdown-02.png "main.swift file showing the pre-defined configuration for the website"" alt="main.swift file showing the pre-defined configuration for the website"/><blockquote><p>Publish uses specific terminology to refer to basic structure of the website. <strong>Pages</strong> are standalone webpages on your website. <strong>Sections</strong> are special types of webpages, navigated using navigation menu. <strong>Items</strong> are blog posts.</p></blockquote><h2>Content Structure</h2><p>When you first generate your website, you'll see two items in <strong>Content</strong>; <strong>index.md</strong> file and <strong>posts</strong> folder. Inside <strong>posts</strong>, there are two files: <strong>index.md</strong> and <strong>first-post.md</strong>.</p><p>The root index file is your website's homepage. You can see it when you open the website in your browser:</p><img src="/images/posts/2022/06/create-portfolio-website-using-publish-03.png "MyWebsite running on local server in Google Chrome"" alt="MyWebsite running on local server in Google Chrome"/><p>Right now, if you try to add anything inside the markdown file it won't render on the website. As you can see, the file is empty, but the homepage of your website has some data displayed. These components get added programmatically using the built-in <strong>Foundation</strong> theme that Publish ships with. Anything you add in both index files is overriden programmatically.</p><p>You won't be creating a custom theme in this post, but you can take a look at the built-in theme and how the components get created programmatically. Under <strong>Package Dependencies</strong>, find <strong>Publish</strong> and expand it. Go to <strong>Sources</strong> -&gt; <strong>Publish</strong> -&gt; <strong>API</strong> and open <strong>Theme+Foundation</strong> file:</p><img src="/images/posts/2022/06/publish-creating-content-with-markdown-03.png "Theme+Foudation.swift file showing the first few lines of code"" alt="Theme+Foudation.swift file showing the first few lines of code"/><blockquote><p>We'll take a look at how to build a custom theme in one of the future posts.</p></blockquote><p>You can try adding more markdown files to <strong>posts</strong> as additional blog posts and once you build your website, they will all appear on your homepage.</p><h2>Adding Sections</h2><p>Open <strong>main.swift</strong> file and add two more sections under <code>SectionID</code>. You can add any section you want. Let's add <strong>about</strong> and <strong>portfolio</strong> sections:</p><pre><code><span class="comment">// This type acts as the configuration for your website.</span>
<span class="keyword">struct</span> MyWebsite: <span class="type">Website</span> {
    <span class="keyword">enum</span> SectionID: <span class="type">String</span>, <span class="type">WebsiteSectionID</span> {
        <span class="comment">// Add the sections that you want your website to contain here:</span>
        <span class="keyword">case</span> posts
        <span class="comment">// New sections</span>
        <span class="keyword">case</span> about
        <span class="keyword">case</span> portfolio
    }
    ...
</code></pre><p>Build the project and you'll see two new folders under <strong>Output</strong>: <strong>about</strong> and <strong>portfolio</strong>. Refresh your website and you'll see two more sections in your navigation menu.</p><p>To populate your new section pages with content, add <strong>about.md</strong> and <strong>portfolio.md</strong> files to the root of <strong>Content</strong> folder. The files need to have the same name as sections. Then write some markdown inside. Build the project and refresh the website:</p><img src="/images/posts/2022/06/publish-creating-content-with-markdown-04.png "About webpage showing the section's content and three navigation menu items: My Posts, About and Portfolio"" alt="About webpage showing the section's content and three navigation menu items: My Posts, About and Portfolio"/><h2>Adding Pages</h2><p>To add standalone pages that you can navigate to using navigation menu, add the markdown file for the page in the root of <strong>Content</strong>. Then, link to the page anywhere you'd like.</p><p>Let's say you want to add a custom <strong>Contact</strong> page. Create a <strong>contact.md</strong> file and add the link to it in about section with markdown <code>[Contact me](/contact)</code>. Build the project, refresh the website and you can navigate to the contact page:</p><img src="/images/posts/2022/06/publish-creating-content-with-markdown-05.png "Contact page with Contact Me! title and two paragraphs"" alt="Contact page with Contact Me! title and two paragraphs"/><hr><p>You've learned how to build your website with markdown using the built-in Foundation theme. You can add sections, standalone pages, and blog posts. You can build a simple static website using markdown only.</p><p>In the future post, you'll learn how to go behind the scenes and build your website in Swift with a custom theme. You'll also learn how to add some flavor and colors with CSS.</p><p>Please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvrzan">Twitter</a> if you have any questions, comments or feedback.</p><p>Thank you for reading and happy coding!</p></div></article></div><footer><p>Copyright Â© 2021-2024 Danijela Vrzan.
