When you need a custom symbol for your app that doesn't exist in the collection, you can customize an existing one or create a new one from scratch.</p><p>I'll show you how to edit an existing symbol to create a custom one.</p><h2>Choose and export an existing symbol</h2><p>The first step in the process is to choose the symbol you want to edit from the <strong>SF Symbols</strong> app. Make sure to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/">download the app</a> if you don't have it yet.</p><blockquote><p>Not all symbols are customizable. Some are copyright protected as they represent Apple products and features. While you can use them in your app as-is, you aren't allowed to edit them. Those symbols will have an "info" badge next to them in the app.</p></blockquote><p>For our example, we'll choose the <code>fork.knife</code> symbol. I want to separate the <strong>fork</strong> and the <strong>knife</strong> objects into their own symbols so I can use them separately.</p><p>When you find the symbol you want to edit, right-click and go to <strong>File -&gt; Export Template</strong>.</p><img src="https://www.danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2024/06/create-custom-sf-symbols-01.png "SF Symbols app window when exporting a template"" alt="SF Symbols app window when exporting a template"/><p>On the bottom left side of the window, you'll see export settings. <strong>Template Setup</strong> has two options to choose from: <strong>Variable</strong> and <strong>Static</strong>. All SF symbols have 27 different variants.</p><p><strong>Static</strong> template gives you the ability to edit all or some of the 27 variants with one set of explicit margins. It requires a lot of work to edit each one by hand so you'd choose this template if you only want to create one or two variants of your symbol. If you only need a <code>semibold</code> symbol you can only create the one you need.</p><p><strong>Variable</strong> template consists of only three editable variants. This is the minimum number required for the system to generate the other 24. You only need to define three variants and the SF Symbol app will use the vector interpolation algorithm to dynamically generate all other weights and scales.</p><p>I'll use the <strong>Variable</strong> template for this example and I'm currently on <strong>SF Symbols 5</strong> version.</p><p>Export the template.</p><p>Now you have a <code>fork.knife.svg</code> file you can use to create your new symbol.</p><h2>Create the symbol in Sketch</h2><p>In this article, I'm using <a href="https://www.sketch.com">Sketch</a> to create my custom symbol, for no specific reason. You can use any vector-drawing tool you like.</p><blockquote><p>I won't get into specific details on how to use Sketch in this article, but I'll help you out a bit if you have never used it before.</p></blockquote><h3>Import the template</h3><p>Open Sketch and go to <strong>File -&gt; Open</strong>... Select the <strong>.svg</strong> file you exported earlier and click <strong>Open</strong>.</p><img src="https://www.danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2024/06/create-custom-sf-symbols-02.png "Sketch app with an SF symbols template"" alt="Sketch app with an SF symbols template"/><p>There is a lot going on, on the screen, but the template is well documented. It's a chart with a legend at the bottom.</p><p>The right side, or y-axis shows different <strong>weight</strong> variants. The top side, or x-axis shows <strong>scale</strong> variants.</p><h3>Edit the template</h3><p>As we've already mentioned earlier, the <strong>Variable</strong> template gives you three different variants, <code>ultralight</code>, <code>regular</code>, and <code>black</code> symbols. They are outlined in the chart on the <code>Small</code> scale.</p><p>You can also see them in the left pane under <strong>Symbols</strong> folder. We won't need <strong>Guides</strong> and <strong>Notes</strong>, so select them, right-click and click <strong>Lock 2 Layers</strong>. This will prevent us from accidentally selecting the alignment lines while we're editing the symbol.</p><p>Expand the <strong>Regular-S</strong> and <strong>Shape</strong> folders on the left pane and you'll see two <strong>Path</strong> components. Symbols are nothing more than paths. Well, they are so much more in our hearts, but as a vector graphics, it's <em>just</em> a path. A collection of connected lines drawn to represent a symbol.</p><p>For this example, we won't be drawing anything, we'll separate the <code>fork</code> and the <code>knife</code> symbols.</p><img src="https://www.danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2024/06/create-custom-sf-symbols-07.png "Selected knife object in Sketch"" alt="Selected knife object in Sketch"/><p>Select the knife path and delete it. Then move the fork path in the middle between the two guides. Repeat for other two variants.</p><blockquote><p>By default, Sketch app doesn't show rulers or guides. You can add them yourself to make sure your symbols are all aligned between the guides.</p></blockquote><h3>Export the template</h3><p>Before exporting the template, we need to rename the symbol. Double-click the root folder with the symbol name and rename the symbol to <code>fork</code>.</p><p>Next, go to <strong>File -&gt; Export...</strong> If you see a dialog asking you what you want to export, make sure to select <strong>Canvas</strong>. On the right pane, a new <strong>EXPORT</strong> window will open. Select <strong>SVG</strong> format in the dropdown and click on <strong>Export Selected...</strong> at the bottom.</p><p>Name the file <strong>fork</strong> and Save.</p><h2>Validate the new symbol in SF Symbols app</h2><p>Now we need to validate the symbol and add it to SF Symbols app.</p><p>Open SF Symbols. On the left pane, scroll down and select <strong>Custom Symbols</strong> folder. Drag and drop the <strong>fork.svg</strong> file.</p><img src="https://www.danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2024/06/create-custom-sf-symbols-03.png "SF Symbols app with the imported custom symbol"" alt="SF Symbols app with the imported custom symbol"/><p>That's it! If all worked out correctly without any issues, your new symbol is ready for use. You can play around with colors and animations. It will work as any other symbol.</p><blockquote><p>If you later decide to update that same symbol, you need to drag and drop the <strong>.svg</strong> file onto the existing symbol and the app will ask if you want to update the current one.</p></blockquote><h2>Add symbol to your Xcode project</h2><p>To add the new symbol to your Xcode project, you need to export it from SF Symbols and import it to <strong>Assets</strong> folder in Xcode.</p><p>Select the symbol and go to <strong>File -&gt; Export Symbol...</strong></p><img src="https://www.danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2024/06/create-custom-sf-symbols-04.png "SF Symbols app window when exporting a symbol"" alt="SF Symbols app window when exporting a symbol"/><p>In the new window, you'll see all the 27 variants created by the algorithm for you. Now click <strong>Export</strong> and save the file.</p><p>In Xcode, open <strong>Assets</strong> folder and drag and drop the file inside:</p><img src="https://www.danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2024/06/create-custom-sf-symbols-05.png "Xcode Assets folder with the new symbol imported"" alt="Xcode Assets folder with the new symbol imported"/><p>To add the symbol to your UI, you need to use the <code>Image("fork")</code> initializer. While it's an SF symbol, it's not part of the SF Symbols app that comes built-in with Xcode. It's an imported symbol file.</p><img src="https://www.danijelavrzan.com/images/posts/2024/06/create-custom-sf-symbols-06.png "Screenshot of Hello World screen with a custom fork symbol"" alt="Screenshot of Hello World screen with a custom fork symbol"/><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>I hope this article gives you a starting point if you ever want to edit or create a custom symbol in your app.</p><p>If you'd like to dive deep into the technical and design aspects of creating a custom symbol, I suggest reading the official documentation on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage/creating_custom_symbol_images_for_your_app">Creating custom symbol images for your app</a> where you can find more on how to customize your icons for different rendering modes.</p><p>Make sure to check the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols">SF Symbols</a> section of the Human Interface Guidelines for more information and best practices when using symbols in your apps.</p><hr><p>Please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvrzan">X (Twitter)</a> or <a href="https://iosdev.space/@dvrzan">Mastodon</a> if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.</p><p>Thank you for reading!</p></div></article></div><footer><p>Copyright © 2021-2024 Danijela Vrzan.
